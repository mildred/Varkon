                           ======

      Installation guide for Varkon 1.19C. This README includes specific
      information for Linux users but should also be used for other
      Unix systems like FreeBSD and MacOSX.

      When you read this file you have either downloaded and installed
      (unpacked) a prebuilt binary version of Varkon or you have downloaded
      and installed the sources. The top directory of the Varkon installation
      is referred to as VARKON_ROOT.

      If you are building Varkon from the sources, follow the instructions
      in the file VARKON_ROOT/sources/README before you continue. This will
      build the executable binaries and the HTML documentation.

      The prebuilt binary version of Varkon includes the full HTML documentation.
      If you build Varkon from the sources the documentation is automatically
      created during the build process.

      The start page of the Varkon documentation is:
      VARKON_ROOT/man/index.htm

      The full documentation is also available online at:
      http://varkon.sourceforge.net/man_1.19C/index.htm

      To finish the installation and start Varkon, follow the instructions
      in the System administrators manual at:
      VARKON_ROOT/man/sysadm/index.htm

      Varkon 1.19C includes many changes compared to 1.19B. For old users
      of Varkon the new concept of a job directory instead of a project
      with a PID file requires special attention. Please read the Release
      notes for 1.19C before you start your new installation. You will find
      a link to the releasenotes on the start page of the Varkon documentation.

      To get in contact with the developers or with other Varkon users,
      please post a message to the Varkon mailing list. Bug reports or
      feature requests are posted through the tracker on the Sourceforge
      project site. See http://sourceforge.net/projects/varkon

      These files are not included in the Varkon distribution.
      If you don't have these files on your Linux system we
      recommend you to download them from your Linux site or
      try an older version of Varkon. Varkon 1.15C is based
      on libc.so.5 and might work better if you have an older
      version of Linux.

      OpenGL
      ------

      The binary version of Varkon 1.19C is comiled and linked on
      a Linux system with Suse Linux 10.0. This Linux distribution
      and many others of recent date include support for OpenGL so
      normally you should not need to do anything to get OpenGL
      working.

      If your system does not include support for OpenGL you must
      install OpenGL on your system.

      TIFF
      ----

      Varkon by default supports the output of TIFF images from
      OpenGL windows. You can turn off TIFF support in the top
      level makefile. See VARKON_ROOT/sources/README.

      ODBC
      ----

      The binary version of Varkon for Linux does not include support
      for ODBC. If you need ODBC support you must build Varkon from
      the sources. See VARKON_ROOT/sources/README_ODBC.
