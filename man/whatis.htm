What is Varkon ?</h1></center>
VARKON can be used as a traditional CAD-system with drafting, modelling
and visualization if you want to but the real power of VARKON is in parametric
modelling and CAD applications development. VARKON includes interactive
parametric modelling in 2D or 3D but also the unique MBS programming language
integrated in the graphical environment.
<p>The system was originally developed by a group at the University of
Linkoping in Sweden during 1984-86 under the leadership of Dr. Johan Kjellander
now the president of Microform AB. Since then the system has been owned,
marketed and further developed by Microform AB. VARKON is a trademark registered
by Microform AB in Sweden.
<p>VARKON has been available for more than 15 years and the number of users
are steadily increasing with systems installed in many Europeean countries
as well as the USA. Customers range from big companies like SAAB Aircraft
to very small companies with only a few employees. There is also an increasing
number of users all over the world running the free version of VARKON for
UNIX and GNU/Linux.
<p>VARKON is written in ANSI portable C and has been compiled and successfully
executed on many different platforms. The UNIX version has a user interface
based on X-Windows and the PC version uses Microsoft WIN32. Currently there
are VARKON systems running on workstations from HP, SUN, IBM and SiliconGraphics
and also systems on VAX's with VMS or Intel PC's with SCO/UNIX, GNU/Linux
or Windows95/98/NT. There is even a customer&nbsp; running Varkon on a
Cray T3E supercomputer with 256&nbsp; 300Mhz 64 bit Alpha processors !
<p>VARKON is not expensive. The UNIX version is distributed in sourcecode
under the GNU/GPL license. There is also a prebuilt binary version for
GNU/Linux free of charge. The current price for a Windows95/NT license
is 875 USD. Support is available for all platforms including GNU/Linux.

how to obtain the software.

<h1>
Some things you can do with VARKON.</h1></center>
VARKON is used to develop and run <b>applications</b>. An application is
a VARKON system that's been modified and extended with knowledge and functionality
specific to a certain product or problem. VARKON applications can perform
any calculations, retrieve data from external databases, make decisions,
perform complex geometrical operations, build object oriented structures
with attributes and geometry, generate graphic images like 2D drawings
or 3D models with shading or hidden lines removed and create any type of
datafiles with output of your own choice.
<p>VARKON is ideally suited for all types of variational design. Wooden
houses, tools for ballbearings, welded steel parts or electrical installations
are some of the products currently designed in VARKON using this technique.
<p>In variational design the actual design work is often reduced to a few
percent of the time spent with traditional methods. Using VARKON with its
unique ability to handle geometry as well as other features and store the
result in a well structured and object oriented manner it is also easy
to produce much more information than paper drawings. Cost estimations,
bill of materials and different forms of manufacturing data are usually
created automatically in VARKON applications.
<p>VARKON is easy to integrate. A VARKON application can communicate using
files or pipes and can spawn other processes as well as being spawned itself.
Using this technique you can either let a VARKON application be on top
and control other systems or you can use other systems to control VARKON.
The Windows95/NT version of the system also includes an ODBC API for communication
with commersial databases.
<p>VARKON is a powerful geometric modeller. Basic 3D entities are points,
lines, arcs, curves, surfaces, coordinate systems and transformations.
Several representations of parametric curves are implemented including
rational polynomial, analytical offset and curves on surfaces so called
UV-curves. Surface representations include rational polynomial, lofted
procedural, analytical offset and a faceted surface for approximations.
Operations include intersects, closest point, silhouette, curvatures, transformation,
trimming, export, import and approximation. Basic visualization as well
as complex rendering based on OpenGL is included in all versions of the
system.
<p>A key feature in all modeling is the capability to record not only the
results of interactive operations but also the operations themselves, making
it possible to go back and inspect what you have done, then change something
and automatically update the model. Being a fully generic system this is
standard behavior in VARKON. All interactive operations are automatically
recorded as MBS-statements and the model can any time be edited using the
MBS-editor instead of interactive graphics if this is preferred. Using
MBS your own design rules or constraints can easily be linked into the
model. Such changes are automatically compiled and the result shown immediately
on the screen.

<h1>
Two things you can't do.</h1></center>
VARKON is not a true solid modeller. VARKON surfaces can be faceted and
images can be produced with shading or hidden lines removed but mass properties
like volume or center of gravity can not be calculated automatically. This
doesn't mean you cant use VARKON in applications where weight or volume
is important. It only means you will have to deal with the problem in other
(maybe less automatic) ways.
<p>VARKON is not a manufacturing (CAM) system. There are no high level
functions in VARKON to support the programming of multi axis numerical
machines. You can create your geometry in VARKON but multi axis machine
programming will have to be done using other software. For less complicated
manufacturing processes though it can surprisingly often be worth the effort
to let VARKON applications generate numerical control data automatically
even if this means extra programming in MBS initially.
