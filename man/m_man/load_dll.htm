  <h2>load_dll - <small><small><small>Function</small></small></small></h2>
  <p>Loads a dynamic link library <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Description<br>
  </b><br>
  Loads the named library into memory and links it to VARKON so that functions within the
  library can be called with the call_dll_function() routine. After a library is loaded it
  remains in memory and need not be loaded again unless it is unloaded using the
  unload_dll() routine. Multiple libraries may be loaded at the same time.<br>
  <br>
  load_dll() is only useful in VARKON for Windows95. MBS-programs including calls to
  load_dll() will compile and run without errors on all platforms but not actually load a
  dll on other platforms than Windows95/NT.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Syntax<br>
  </b><br>
  load_dll(name)<br>
  <br>
  STRING name;<br>
  <b><u><br>
  </u>Principal parameters<br>
  </b><br>
  name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The name of the dll library file. If
  a path is not included the Windows standard<br>
  directories will be searched. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <b>Optional parameters<br>

  <p><br>
  <b>Return value</b><br>
  <br>
  An INT equal to zero if the library was loaded or -1 if an error occured. 1 is returned if
  the library was already loaded.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Examples<br>
  </b><br>
  status:=load_dll(&quot;C:\MYLIB\MYDLL.DLL&quot;);<br>
  <br>
  Loads the MYDLL library in the C:\MYLIB directory. If successful status = 0. If not
  successful status = -1. If the library already is loaded status = 1.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Comments</b><br>
  <br>
  load_dll() can be used to load libraries written in any language and compiled with any
  compiler as long as they conform to the rules of a standard Microsoft Dynamic Link
  Library. See the call_dll_function() for more information about using dll's.<br>
  <br>
  The maximum number possible to load at the same time (without unloading) is currently set
  to 25.<br>
  <br>
  It is not regarded as an error to load the same library two or more times without
  unloading it first. If a library is already loaded load_dll does nothing and returns 1.<br>
