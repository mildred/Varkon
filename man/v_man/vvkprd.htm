<B>Description<BR>
<BR>
</B>Environment variable used by VARKON as default root directory for new
projects. Each project is defined by a PID-file located in $VARKON_PID
listing different directories to be used within the project. It's good
practice to place these directories in a common directory with the same
name as the project. For a project named &quot;shafts&quot; this means
that directories like job, code, lib, mbs, sym, doc, mdf and so on should
be placed in a common directory named shafts and that the shafts directory
together with other project directories should be placed in $VARKON_PRD.
<BR>
<BR>
It is strongly adviced to gather projects in a common (root) directory
outside the directory tree of the VARKON system. Dont use VARKON_ROOT/something
for VARKON_PRD. Use $HOME/app or some other directory that is not involved
when a new version of VARKON is installed (and an old version removed).
See VARKON_PID for the same reason.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Example<BR>
<BR>
</B>If VARKON_PRD is set to $HOME/app this means that job files for the
&quot;shafts&quot; project will be placed in $HOME/app/shafts/job.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Comments<BR>
<BR>
</B>If VARKON_PRD is not defined a hard coded default will be used.<BR>
<BR>
The organization of projects and directories suggested above is only a
suggestion. Other ways to organize your files may work just as well.</P>
