<H3>Explicit modeling</H3>

<P>In VARKON's normal mode of operation the user has no direct access to
the explicit result he is creating. All operations are done on the generic
model and VARKON updates the GM database automatically. <BR>
<BR>
There are situations though where it is essential to be able to work on
the explicit model directly and for this situation VARKON has an explicit
mode of operation as well (the -r option). In explicit mode VARKON acts
very much like a traditional CAD-system with all the danger and restriction
that this implies. <BR>
<BR>
You can create the same things in explicit mode as in generic mode, even
call a <B>MODULE</B> with parameters to create a part but you can never
go back, make changes and get everything updated automatically. Local changes
are possible though. You may for example change the value of any parameters
of a part but VARKON will only update the changed part and not the entire
model as would be the case in generic mode.<BR>
<BR>
Explicit modeling relates to generic modeling in much the same way as for
example Microsoft's Word relates to Excel. In word-processing the result
is what you see on the screen and there are no relations or dependencies
between different parts of the text. This gives you total freedom to make
any changes you want. <BR>
<BR>
In Excel you don't have this freedom since different figures in the text
may be related to each other through mathematical expressions etc. In Excel
there is a (generic) model that describes the operations necessary to compute
the result and if you change a figure in the text all dependent figures
are changed automatically.</P>
