<H3>The bounded plane</H3>

<P>VARKON includes a simple planar surface called B-plane. A B-plane is
defined by four positions in the following manner.....<BR>
<BR>
<B>b_plane</B>(id,p1,p2,p3,p4);<BR>
<BR>
p1 through p4 are considered as vertices of a planar polygon and must therefore
all be positions in one and the same plane. VARKON also expects the polygon
to be convex. With four different positions VARKON creates a plane bounded
by four straight lines but if p2 is set equal to p3 then a three sided
plane is created.<BR>
<BR>
B-planes can be used when generating intersects but the main purpose is
to make it possible to produce images with automatic removal of hidden
lines. B-planes have two sides where one is regarded as the outside and
the other as the inside. If viewed from the outside a B-plane will hide
everything behind it. Wireframe objects as well as other B-planes and sculptured
surfaces are all clipped to the borders of the B-plane. If viewed from
the inside a B-plane doesn't hide anything. In many respects a B-plane
is thus the same thing as a planar <I>face</I> in a solid modeller.<BR>
<BR>
When VARKON creates an image with hidden lines removed it will only display
those parts of the model that are not hidden by B-planes but it will also
add and display all visible B-plane/B-plane intersects automatically. This
means that if you dress two wireframe objects with B-planes and let the
objects intersect then VARKON will produce the same image with hidden lines
removed and new edges added as would be the result if using a true faceted
solid modeller. <BR>
<BR>
Many VARKON applications use B-planes to produce realistic images. For
objects with complex shape this may require large numbers of B-planes.
Due to the simple implementation of B-planes though the algorithm for removal
of hidden lines is very fast and scales almost linearly. One thousand B-planes
are processed in 2 seconds on a PC with a 90 Mhz Pentium processor. </P>

<P>The VARKON shader (based on OpenGL) can be used to produce shaded images
of surfaces as well as B-planes.</P>
