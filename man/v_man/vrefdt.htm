<H3>The REF datatype</H3>

<P>Each entity in VARKON has a unique identity composed by sequence number
and order number. The following line for example...<BR>
<BR>
<B>lin_free</B>(#5,p1,p2);<BR>
<BR>
has a sequence number equal to 5. If the line statement is placed in a
for-loop and executed more than once....</P>

<PRE><B>for </B>i:=1 <B>to</B> 10 <B>do
  lin_free</B>(#5,p1,p2);
<B>endfor</B>;
</PRE>

<P>then the first line becomes #5.1 the second #5.2 and so on. Ordernumbers
are created automatically by VARKON at runtime. In order to refer to an
entity belonging to a specific part we must also know the identity of the
part. If a module A calls a module B using <B>part</B>(#1,B()) and module
B creates a line #5 then the global identity of the line is #1#5. Replace
the #'s with slashes and think of how your files are organized in a tree
structure on your harddisk. This is almost the same. VARKON includes a
special datatype called REF used to hold the value of an identity....<BR>
<BR>
<B>REF</B> id;<BR>
<BR>
id:=#5.2#7#8#2.25;<BR>
<BR>
In this example a variable of type REF is declared and assigned a value
representing a reference to an entity #2.25 in a part #8 belonging to a
part #7 belonging to the second instance of the part #5.<BR>
<BR>
References just like filepaths are normally treated as local meaning they
are relative to the position in the tree where they are used. A global
reference though is treated as relative to the absolute top of the tree
structure. The syntax in MBS is ## for a global and # for a local reference.<BR>
<BR>
id:=##5.2#7#8#2.25;<BR>
<BR>
This is the global version of the previous example. A REF-parameter is
a powerful way to express a relation between two objects. The following
module creates a point in the middle of an arbitrary line.</P>

<PRE>GEOMETRY MODULE mid_point(REF line_id;);

BEGINMODULE
<B>  </B>poi_free(#1,on(line_id,0.5));
ENDMODULE
