<H3>Coordinate systems</H3>

<P>There are two ways to create a coordinate system in VARKON. You can
use....<BR>
<BR>
<B>csys_1p</B>(#1,name,p1,vx,vy,vz);<BR>
<BR>
which creates a coordinate system with origin in p1 rotated in order vx
degrees around the X-axis then vy degrees around the Y-axis and finally
vz degrees around the Z-axis. The other way is...<BR>
<BR>
<B>csys_3p</B>(#1,name,p1,p2,p3);<BR>
<BR>
where p1 is the origin, p2 a position on the X-axis and p3 a position in
the XY-plane indicating the direction of the positive Y-axis. In both cases
the coordinate system should be given an appropriate name indicating its
purpose.<BR>
<BR>
Coordinate systems created like this are <B>LOCAL</B> systems. A <B>LOCAL
</B>system is activated using...<BR>
<BR>
<B>mode_local</B>(id);<BR>
<BR>
where id is the identity of the system to activate. When a <B>LOCAL</B>
system is activated all coordinates and angles used to create new geometry
is treated as relative to the <B>LOCAL</B> system. Geometric operations
requiring a 2D plane also use the XY-plane of the <B>LOCAL</B> system when
this is active. There is no limit to the number of systems that can be
created and any system can be activated in any order as often as needed.<BR>
<BR>
Every module has a default coordinate system created and activated automatically
when it starts its execution. This system is called the module's <B>GLOBAL</B>
system and is always active until a <B>LOCAL</B> system is activated with
<B>mode_local</B>. To activate the <B>GLOBAL </B>system again use....<BR>
<BR>
<B>mode_global</B>();<BR>
<BR>
There is also a coordinate system in VARKON called <B>BASIC</B>. The <B>BASIC</B>
system is the superior main coordinate system that all other systems are
related to and also the system to which all geometry is transformed when
saved in the GM database.<B> GLOBAL</B> and <B>BASIC </B>may seem the same
but <B>GLOBAL</B> systems can change when one module calls another and
therefore there is also a....<BR>
<BR>
<B>mode_basic</B>();<BR>
<BR>
in VARKON for those modules who want to be absolutely sure that something
is done relative to the <B>BASIC</B> system.</P>
