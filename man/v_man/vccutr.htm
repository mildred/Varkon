<H3>Composite curves and trimming</H3>

<P>Straight lines, circular arcs, cubic rational curves, UV-curves, offset
curves and composite curves can be combined in any order to create new
composite curves using...<BR>
<BR>
<B>cur_comp</B>(#1,cur_id_1,cur_id_2,.......cur_id_n);<BR>
<BR>
VARKON checks that C0 continuity is preserved but lets you define a kink
if that's what you want to. Composite curves act exactly as all other curves
in VARKON. You can create an offset to a composite, you can use a composite
for intersects and you can even define a surface using a composite. <BR>
<BR>
If you need to reverse the sense of direction for a curve or just need
to make it shorter then the following method can be used.....<BR>
<BR>
<B>cur_trim</B>(#1,cur_id,parval_1,parval_2);<BR>
<BR>
<B>cur_trim</B> changes the parametrisation of a curve by making the position
corresponding to parval_1 its new start and the position corresponding
to parval_2 its new end. By simply supplying the old end as the new start
and the old start as the new end a new curve is created with opposite sense
of direction. By supplying values elsewhere the curve is cut and reparametrised
on the new interval. This is the same as trimming. Splitting is a similar
operation (opposite to <B>cur_comp</B>) where <B>cur_trim</B> is used to
divide a curve in two or more separate pieces each piece being a new curve
of its own.<BR>
<BR>
<B>cur_trim</B> can also be used for extrapolation of the first or last
segment of a curve. Extrapolation is made by first creating a new segment
using the same coefficients as the old segment but the new (larger) interval
for curve parameter and then reparametrise the new (longer) segment to
the standard interval 0 -&gt; 1.</P>
