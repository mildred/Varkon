<H3>Selecting solutions when there is more than one</H3>

<P>There are many geometrical problems that have more than one solution.
A line tangent to a curve (<B>lin_tan1</B> in MBS) is one example. If the
curve oscillates then it is probably easy to find many lines starting in
the same position but joining the curve with tangency in different places.
Intersect is another example. If a line intersects a curve or if a curve
intersects another curve (or arc) then it's clearly possible to end up
with more than one solution.<BR>
<BR>
In interactive CAD-systems it is common practice to supply routines like
<B>lin_tan1</B> or <B>intersect</B> with a hint in the form of an approximate
position. This gives the underlying mathematical algorithm a good starting
value for the numerical solution and makes it unnecessary to calculate
more than one solution which saves time.<BR>
<BR>
In VARKON all solutions are always calculated and the user only supplies
a relative number to select which one he's interested in. This approach
takes more CPU-time of course but also makes it possible to solve problems
without having to supply approximate solutions. In parametric design this
is important since changes to parameters may change the corresponding geometry
significantly and thereby move points of tangency or intersect to completely
new positions.<BR>
<BR>
Other routines based on the same principle are <B>lin_tan2, arc_fil, inv_on,</B>
<B>inv_on_sur, inv_tang</B> and <B>inv_curv.</B></P>
