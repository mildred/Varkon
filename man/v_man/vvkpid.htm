VARKON_PID</H3>
Environment variable
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>Description</B>
<P>Environment variable used by VARKON to locate project files. Project
files are small text files describing a specific project having the same
name but appended with ".PID" ie. shafts.PID is the project file for a
project named shafts. A PID file contains 6 lines of text describing different
directories to be used and the MDF-(menu) file to be used.
<P>Line 1: Job directory
<BR>Line 2: Module libraries
<BR>Line 3: Symbol library
<BR>Line 4: Help libray
<BR>Line 5: MDF file
<BR>Line 6: MBS source library
<P>The job directory is the place where all files related to all jobs within
the project are placed. A module library is an alternate place automatically
searched if a module called is not found in the job directory. More than
one module library may be specified separated with semicolon. VARKON will
search them in the order they appear on the line. A symbol libray is an
alternate place automatically searched if a symbol (.PLT file) is not found
in the job directory. A help library is an alternate place for help files
(.DOC). The MBS-library is the directory used by the "mbs-part-edit" function
to locate editable MBS-files.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>Example</B>
<P>$HOME/app/shafts/job
<BR>$HOME/app/shafts/lib;$HOME/app/common/lib
<BR>$HOME/app/shafts/sym
<BR>$HOME/app/shafts/doc
<BR>$HOME/app/shafts/mdf/shafts.MDF
<BR>$HOME/app/shafts/mbs
<P>For a project named shafts this migth be an appropriate PID file. All
files related to the project are gathered in different directories under
a common directory named shafts. shafts together with other projects are
placed in a common directory named app. Line 2 indicates that users of
this project should have acces to a module libray in $HOME/app/shafts/lib
but also to a common library named $HOME/app/common/lib
<P><B>Comments</B>
<P>If VARKON_PID is not defined a hard coded default will be used instead.
<P>All users need read and write permissions to the VARKON_PID directory.
<P>If VARKON_PID points to a non existent directory or if permissions are
missing the result is unpredictable.
<P>In order to keep existing projects when a new version of VARKON is installed
it is wise to place project files in a directory outside the tree defined
by VARKON_ROOT. $HOME/pid is a good place if projects are personal or some
common directory if many users need access to the same projects.
<P>PID-files are created automatically by VARKON if you ask for it but
may also be created or edited by hand or by scripts or in other ways.
<P>If the first character of the line in a PID file is a dollar sign the
string followed until next slash or end of line will be interpreted as
an environment variable. /usr/$MY_LIBS/lib is not accepted but $MY_LIBS/lib
is.</UL>
