WindowPac (WP) is Varkon's widget library. It includes low level
routines to create and process events from buttons, edits and
icons but also higher level routines to display or print 3D entities
either as wireframes or as colored surfaces using OpenGL in graphical
windows. It also takes care of things like menus and list windows.

WP compiles on UNIX/X11 platforms but also on the WIN32 platform.

WP is a complete widget library of it's own. It does not need
Xt, Motif, MFC or similar libraries. WP needs OpenGL (GL and GLu).
GLut or GLaux or similar libraries are not needed.

WP is of course made for Varkon but it shouldn't be too hard
to use it in other applications if you want to. It does depend
on some of the global data defined in the IG module and it does
depend on the entity defs in DB.h
