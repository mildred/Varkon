1. Make sure you have built the DB library and
   VU library, DBlib.a and VUlib.a
   See DB/src/README and VU/src/README

2. cd to the DB/demo directory

3. A Makefile for linux is included in the demo directory.
   Type "make -f Makefile.linux" to build the DB demo programs.

4. Run the programs. Too see what they do, read
   the sources of each program.
   They are fairly well commented.
