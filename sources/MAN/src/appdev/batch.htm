<h1>Running Varkon in batch mode</h1>

<p>
If you want Varkon to start with a specific module, execute
it automatically and then exit without having made any output
to the display you can supply the -b parameter to Varkon in the
start script when Varkon is started. This is called "batch mode".
</p>

<p>
If you want to run Varkon in batch mode it is important to use a
start script where you also supply the job directory and the job
name on the line that starts Varkon. Here is an example:
</p>

<p><tt>
&nbsp;$VARKON_BIN/xvarkon module_name -jd/home/my_application/job -b
</tt></p>

<p>
Error messages issued by Varkon while in batch mode are written
to the file Varkon.LOG in the job directory.
