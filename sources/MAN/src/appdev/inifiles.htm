<h1>Ini-files</h1>

<p>
Ini-files are used by Varkon to initialize various system
parameters and values during startup (in the X-windows
community such things are called "resources"). The standard
Varkon distribution includes a default ini-file but you can also
create an application specific ini-file with settings that
will override the default values. The way to do that is
to edit the line that starts the Varkon executable in the
Varkon start script located in $VARKON_ROOT/com/english (or
$VARKON_ROOT/com/swedish). Read the comments in the startscript
for details.
</p>

<p>
If you use an application specific ini-file, be sure to
keep it somwhere where it will not be affected if the
Varkon system is updated to a new release. A natural
place to keep an application specific ini-file is together
with the application module library. This will make it
easy to package the application and install it somewhere
else.
</p>

<p>
See the default ini-file in $VARKON_ROOT/cnf/ini/english
(or $VARKON_ROOT/cnf/ini/swedish) for more information
on available system parameters and values (resources).
