<h1>Menu files</h1>

<p>
The menus loaded when Varkon is started are defined by the text file
pointed to by the environment variable VARKON_MDF in the Varkon start
script. Menufiles are ordinary text files having names ending with
<code>.MDF</code> (MenuDefinitionFile). Once the system is started,
additional files can be loaded from MBS with the LOAD_MDF() procedure.
You can also change the value of VARKON_MDF in the Varkon start script
to point to your own application specific menufile.
</p>

<p>
Menufiles define menus, texts (t-strings) and PF-keys
(accelerators) or <code>#include</code> other menufiles. If you want to use
your own application specific menufile we recommend that you first
<code>#include</code> the Varkon system default file and then add your own menus,
texts or PF-key definitions. Here is an example....
</p>

<pre class=box>
! This is the menufile for &quot;my_application&quot;
! The name of the menufile is &quot;my_application.MDF&quot;
! First of all we load the system defaults
#include &quot;$VARKON_ROOT/mdf/english/x11.MDF&quot;

! Then we create a new menu

m200 = &quot;NEW_MENU&quot;
&quot;line 1&quot;,action_1
&quot;line 2&quot;,action_2
&quot;line 3&quot;,action_3;

! Note that the last line is terminated by a semicolon.
! We can also define some t-strings......

t600 = &quot;text 1&quot;
t601 = &quot;text 2&quot;
t603 = &quot;text 3&quot;

! and program a PF-key  (F2) to pop up menu 201.

s50 = &quot;%27B&quot;,m201

! Finally we may want to indicate that our new menu
! number 200 above should be used as the main menu.

Main_menu = 200
</pre>

<p>
Use menu numbers from 200 and up. Numbers lower than 200 are reserved by
the system. Numbers higher than 400 are illegal.
</p>

<h2> The syntax of a menu definition is:</h2>
<p>
mn = &quot;Menu_name&quot;<br>
<br>
followed by one or more lines of the following form:<br>
<br>
&quot;text&quot;,action<br>
<br>
the last line terminated by a semicolon ;<br>
<br>
&quot;Menu_name&quot; is an arbitrary heading that will be displayed at
the top of the menu. &quot;text&quot; is an arbitrary text describing the
action to take place when this alternative is selected. <br>
<br>
action is the letter &quot;m&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;p&quot;,
&quot;r&quot;, or &quot;a&quot; followed by a number n.<br>
<br>
&quot;m&quot; activates menu n.<br>
&quot;f&quot; activates built in function n. See VARKON_ROOT/sources/IG/include/futab.h for function numbers.<br>
&quot;M&quot; calls a MACRO module named by t-string n.<br>
&quot;p&quot; calls a module named by t-string n and creates a part.<br> &quot;r&quot; same as &quot;p&quot; but without saving the part call in the active
module.<br>
&quot;a&quot; stands for &quot;alternative&quot; and performs no
action but can be used with MBS.<br>
<br>
The following MBS routines apply to menus: CRE_MEN(), GET_MEN(), PSH_MEN(),
POP_MEN() and GET_ALT().<br>
</p>

<h2>t-strings are defined using the following syntax:</h2>
<p>
tn = &quot;text&quot;<br>
<br>
where n must be a number from 600 up to 1500. Lower and higher numbers
are reserved by the system. A t-string is just a text with a number and
may be used for any purpose you can think of. The &quot;M&quot;, &quot;p&quot;
and &quot;r&quot; actions in menus rely on t-strings to store the name
of the module to be called. Varkon uses the values of t-strings
when displaying messages of various kinds. MBS-routines CRE_TSTR() and
GET_TSTR() can be used to create a t-string and retrieve its value from
MBS.
</p>

<h2>PF-keys are defined using the following syntax:</h2>
<p>
sn = &quot;%27c&quot;,action<br>
<br>
where c is a character in the range &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Z&quot; and
action is the same as described above for menus. &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Z&quot;
gives a total number of 26 individual PF-keys or accelerators. &quot;%27A&quot;
is PF1, &quot;%27B&quot; is PF2 and so on. Most keyboards don't have as
many as 26 PF-keys but might emulate extra keys by the use of &lt;SHIFT&gt;PF1,
&lt;SHIFT&gt;PF2 etc. s1 to s12 are reserved by Varkon for the standard
PF-key setup. You may redefine any of these if you wish in your own menufile
and you may also add new ones.<br>
