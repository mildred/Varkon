<h1>Where should I keep my macros</h1>

<p>
If the macros you have created are used with jobs
stored in the same location the easiest way
is probably to have them in the lib of that location. You
can then easily access them for editing and Varkon will
automatically find them when you call them, just like ordinary
modules.
</p>

<p>
If you have macros that you want to use with jobs located
in different places in your file system you need to
inform Varkon where your macros are located. See below.
</p>

<p>
The Varkon system includes a large number of macro
modules that are used by the Varkon user interface.
You will find the sources in <code>VARKON_ROOT/sources/Vlib</code>
and the (compiled) modules in <code>VARKON_ROOT/lib</code>.
</p>

<p>
The startscript included in the Varkon distribution sets
up the VARKON_LIB environment variable to point to
<code>VARKON_ROOT/lib</code>. It is strongly recommended not to change
or add anything in the standard library. Keep all your
own macros somewhere else, outside the Varkon system file tree
and point to your own macro libraries by adding them to
the VARKON_LIB environment variable defined in the Varkon
start script. Here is an example:
</p>

<pre class=box>
  VARKON_LIB=the_path_to_my_own_library:$VARKON_ROOT/lib
</pre>

<p>
With VARKON_LIB defined as above Varkon will
first search your own library and if not successful, search
the Varkon standard library. VARKON_LIB permits up to 10 libraries to
be defined like this and Varkon will search them in the order
they appear. Note that there is only one single namespace for
all modules including the Varkon standard macro modules.
You must use unique names for all your modules. Names used
by Varkon begin with <code>l_, dxf_, ed_, fe_, igs_, ma_ or stl_</code>.
If you don't actually mean to replace a Varkon standard macro,
it is best to avoid names beginning with these letter combinations
for all types of modules.

for similar information related to non macro modules.
