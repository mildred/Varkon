<h1>Application specific documentation</h1>

<p>
A good Varkon application needs it's own documentation.
If you have application specific documentation in html
format you can make it available online through the
Varkon context sensitive help system by placing the
html file(s) in the current job directory or by altering
the value of the VARKON_DOC variable in the Varkon start
script.
</p>

<p>
When a user calls for help, Varkon searches the current job
directory for the required html file before the system
directory specified by VARKON_DOC is searched. Each module
in the application may have a doc file of it's own. You may
also have an individual doc file for each menu.
</p>

<p>
See <a HREF="../GUI/f153.htm">f153</a> for more
information about the interactive help system and how
to name your doc files.
