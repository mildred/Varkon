<h1>Module libraries</h1>

<p>
The obvious way to start developing a Varkon application is
of course to create the modules (MBS- and MBO-files) that are
needed to represent the range of objects that the application
will be able to create.
</p>

<p>
It may be convenient to move the MBS- and MBO-files of an
application to one or more folders or directories that can be
accessed by all jobs and users of that application. If you
do so you must tell Varkon where they are. The way to
do that is to edit the definition of the VARKON_LIB environment
variable in the Varkon start script.
</p>

<p>
The startscript included in the Varkon distribution sets
up the VARKON_LIB environment variable to point to
<code>VARKON_ROOT/lib</code>. It is strongly recommended not to change
or add anything in the standard library. Keep all your
own modules somewhere else, outside the Varkon system file tree
and point to your own module libraries by adding them to
the VARKON_LIB environment variable defined in the Varkon
start script. Here is an example:
</p>

<p><code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;VARKON_LIB=the_path_to_my_own_library:$VARKON_ROOT/lib
</code></p>

<p>
With VARKON_LIB defined as above Varkon will
first search your own library and if not successful, search
the Varkon standard library. VARKON_LIB permits up to 10 libraries to
be defined like this and Varkon will search them in the order
they appear. Note that there is only one single namespace for
all modules including the Varkon standard modules.
You must use unique names for all your modules. Names used
by Varkon begin with <code>l_, dxf_, ed_, fe_, igs_, ma_ or stl_</code>.
If you don't actually mean to replace a Varkon standard module,
it is best to avoid names beginning with these letter combinations
for all types of modules, also macro modules.
