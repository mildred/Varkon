<h1>Start scripts</h1>

<p>
Varkon can only be started by executing a start script
that sets up an environment for Varkon to function properly.
The default start scripts in the Varkon distribution are
located in <code>$VARKON_ROOT/com/english and $VARKON_ROOT/com/swedish</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you develop an application with specific needs you can
use an individual start script for that application. Make
a copy of the default start script, edit it to suit your
needs, then store it with the rest of the application
files and use it to start the application.
</p>

<p>
The things you might want to change in the start script
are environment variables that point to the menus to be used,
the module librarie(s) or the documentation. You may also
want to edit the line that starts the Varkon executable and
supply application specific parameters like the default
job directory or an application specific ini-file. See the
<a href="../sysadm/start_script.htm">startscript section</a>
in the System administrators manual for more information.
