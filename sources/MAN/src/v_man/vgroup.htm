<H3>Group</H3>

<P>A <B>group</B> is a non geometric entity with a name and a list of members.
In its simplest form a <B>group</B> can be used to associate a text with
a single entity.....<BR>
<BR>
<B>arc_1pos</B>(#1,vec(0,0),10);<BR>
<B>group</B>(#2,&quot;screwhole&quot;,#1);<BR>
<BR>
In this example a <B>group</B> is created with name = screwhole and the
arc #1 is its only member. The significance of this would be that the arc
represents a screw hole, information that could be used for example by
another application during process planning or cost estimation. The <B>group</B>
entity is implemented using two way pointers between the <B>group</B> and
its members. The arc entity knows which <B>group</B> it belongs to and
the<B> group</B> entity knows where its members are.<BR>
<BR>
A <B>group</B> can also be used to combine several entities into a common
structure...<BR>
<BR>
<B>poi_free</B>(#1,vec(0,0));<BR>
<B>poi_free</B>(#2,vec(100,0));<BR>
<B>poi_free</B>(#3,vec(50,50));<BR>
<B>group</B>(#4,&quot;triangle&quot;,#1,#2,#3);<BR>
<BR>
In this case a <B>group</B> #4 is created with three points as members
and name = triangle. Each point holds information that it belongs to <B>group</B>
#4 and the <B>group</B> itself holds its name and the identity of its three
members. Any entity including <B>group</B> itself can belong to a maximum
of 3 different <B>groups</B> at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
The <B>group </B>entity is a way to create a structural relationship or
context in much the same way as the<B> part</B>. A <B>part</B> is more
powerful but also more complex to use. A <B>part</B> needs a defining <B>MODULE</B>,
uses parameters and holds any number of entities while a <B>group </B>only
has a name and can only hold a maximum of 100 members.<BR>
<BR>
In many cases it turns out best to use the <B>part</B> to describe different
objects and the <B>group</B> to describe smaller structures within the
object. A <B>group</B> can also be used to express a relation between two
different <B>parts.</B></P>
