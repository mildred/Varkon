PMSIZE</H3>
System variable
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>Description</B>
<P>PMSIZE is the size of the PM memory area in bytes. Default value = 400Kb.
PMSIZE can be increased (or decreased) by supplying the -pm parameter on
the commandline when VARKON is started.
<P>Example:
<P>-pm800000
<P>Sets PMSIZE = 0.8Mb
<P>PM is the place where VARKON keeps the active module and PMSIZE therefore
sets the maximum size of the active module. VARKON also allocates a second
memory area of the same size as PM and uses this to keep modules that are
called by the active module. Subsequently PMSIZE also sets the maximum
size of a called module.
<P>The secondary PM is used as a cache. When a module is called for the
first time it is always loaded from disc but when it is executed it is
left in the cache. If the module is called again and hasn't left the cache
it does not need to be read from disc a second time. This process goes
on until the cache is full of modules and there is no room for another
module. When this happens the entire cache is cleared and the process is
started from the beginning again.
<P><B>Comments</B>
<P>The cache mechanism of the secondary PM can increase execution speed
significantly if PMSIZE is large enough to hold all called modules at the
same time.</UL>
