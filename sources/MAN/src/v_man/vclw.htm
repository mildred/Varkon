<UL>VARKON supports color printouts through the PEN attribute. Pen 1 is
usually black, pen 2 red, pen 3 green, pen 4 blue and so on. The PEN attribute
can be used in conjunction with the WIDTH attribute to produce a colored
printout with user defined linewidths. The "-bw" parameter can be used
to force a color printer to neglect pen numbers and only print in black.
This is useful if a color printerdriver like "postscript" or "msw32.dll"
is used for a non color printer which may otherwise try to emulate color
by the use of grayscales.
<P>VARKON supports variable linewidth in two different ways. The normal
way that should be used in new applications is to use the WIDTH attribute
to control linewidth. VARKON's plotterdrivers support the WIDTH attribute
directly if the printer supports variable linewidth or emulate variable
linewidth by painting if the printer does not support it. The "postscript"
driver for example supports variable linewidth directly since variable
linewidth is supported by the postscript specification. Other drivers like
the "epson" driver for example automatically create wide lines by painting
as many parallell thin lines as required to achieve the selected width.
The -ws plotterdriver option may be used to override the -s option for
scaling of linewidth during plotting.
<P>The other way linewidth is supported is through the use of penfiles.
This is an older method that is kept alive to support older applications
and it is still supported by all printer drivers. We do not reccommend
this method for new applications as it might be removed from VARKON in
a future release. All printer drivers support the "-pf" parameter which
enables you to specify the name of a penfile. A penfile maps the PEN attribute
to specific linewidths. Pen 1 could be 0.5 millimeters, pen 2 could be
1.0 millimeters and so on. You can not use this method in conjunction with
color or the WIDTH attribute. Do not use the "-pf" parameter if you want
to use PEN for color or WIDTH for linewidth.</UL>
