<P><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P>VARKON &copy; is a high level development tool for applications in the
area of Engineering, Computer Aided Design and Product Modeling.</P>

<P>The system was originally developed by a group at the University of
Linkoping in Sweden during 1984-86 under the leadership of Dr. J.A.P. Kjellander
now the president of Microform AB. Since then the system has been owned,
marketed and further developed by Microform AB. VARKON is a trademark registered
by Microform AB in Sweden.</P>

<P>VARKON is written in ANSI portable C and has been compiled and successfully
executed on many different platforms. The UNIX version has a user interface
based on X-Windows and the PC-version uses Microsoft WIN32. Currently there
are VARKON-systems running on workstations from HP, SUN, IBM and SiliconGraphics
and also systems on VAX’s with VMS or PC’s with SCO/UNIX, LINUX or Windows95/NT.

<H3>What is VARKON ?</H3>

<P>VARKON is a completely open general purpose interactive modeling system
but also a programming language, an object oriented database, a sculptured
surface modeller, fully parametric in 2D and 3D and a very powerful development
tool. VARKON can even be used as a 2D drafting system when this is needed.
<BR>
</P>

<P>VARKON can be used as a traditional 2D drafting editor (ie. Autocad)
if you want to but the real power of the system is in parametric design
and CAD applications development. The corner-stone in the system is the
integrated MBS programming language with its compiler and interactive environment.
MBS includes all the general functionality you would expect from a high
level language:<BR>
<BR>
- 7 Datatypes including STRING, REF and VECTOR<BR>
<BR>
- Flow control like if, for and goto<BR>
<BR>
- File I/O<BR>
<BR>
- Standard library<BR>
<BR>
but also extensive support for development in the areas of: <BR>
<BR>
- Window based user interfaces<BR>
<BR>
- Geometric modeling<BR>
<BR>
- Product modeling (structures, relations and attributes)<BR>
<BR>
- Object oriented database storage and retrieval<BR>
<BR>
- Graphics output and viewing<BR>
<BR>
A minimal application can be developed in only a few minutes if you want
to. There is a standard user interface and a standard library of functions
but you would probably prefer to modify them or replace them completely
as you proceed.<BR>
<BR>
A well designed application acts as a completely new system with its own
user interface and functionality. You can develop for your own use or for
others in your organization or to resell anywhere in the world. You are
free to distribute your own applications as much as you want but each computer
needs a separate license for the VARKON runtime environment.</P>

<H3>Some things you can do with VARKON.</H3>

<P>With VARKON you develop and run <B>applications</B>. An application
is a VARKON system that's been modified and extended with knowledge and
functionality specific to a certain product or problem. VARKON applications
can perform any calculations, retrieve data from external databases, make
decisions, perform complex geometrical operations, build object oriented
structures with attributes and geometry, generate graphic images like 2D
drawings or 3D models with hidden lines removed and create any type of
datafiles with output of your own choice.<BR>
<BR>
VARKON is ideally suited for all types of variational design. Wooden houses,
tools for ballbearings, welded steel parts or electrical installations
are some of the products currently designed in VARKON using this technique.<BR>
<BR>
In variational design the actual design work is often reduced to a few
percent of the time spent with traditional methods. Using VARKON with its
unique ability to handle geometry as well as other<B> </B>features and
store the result in a well structured and object oriented manner it is
also easy to produce much more information than paper drawings. Cost estimations,
bill of materials and different forms of manufacturing data are usually
created automatically in VARKON applications. <BR>
<BR>
VARKON is easy to integrate. A VARKON application can communicate using
files or pipes and can spawn other processes as well as being spawned itself.
Using this technique you can either let a VARKON application be on top
and control other systems or you can use other systems to control VARKON.
<BR>
<BR>
VARKON is a powerful geometric modeller. Basic 3D entities are points,
lines, arcs, curves, surfaces, coordinate systems and transformations.
Several representations of parametric curves are implemented including
rational polynomial, analytical offset and curves on surfaces so called
UV-curves. Surface representations include rational polynomial, lofted
procedural, analytical offset and a faceted surface for approximations.
Operations include intersects, closest point, silhouette, curvatures, transformation,
trimming, export, import and approximation. <BR>
<BR>
A key feature in all modeling is the capability to record not only the
results of interactive operations but also the operations themselves, making
it possible to go back and inspect what you have done, then change something
and automatically update the model. Being a fully generic system this is
standard behavior in VARKON. All interactive operations are automatically
recorded as MBS-statements and the model can any time be edited using the
MBS-editor instead of interactive graphics if this is preferred. Using
MBS your own design rules or constraints can easily be linked into the
model. Such changes are automatically compiled and the result shown immediately
on the screen.</P>

<H3>Two things you can't do.</H3>

<P>VARKON is not a true solid modeller. VARKON surfaces can be faceted
and images can be produced with shading or hidden lines removed automatically
but mass properties like volume or center of gravity can not be calculated
automatically. This doesn't mean you cant use VARKON in applications where
weight or volume is important. It only means you will have to deal with
the problem in other (maybe less automatic) ways. <BR>
<BR>
VARKON is not a manufacturing (CAM) system. There are no high level functions
in VARKON to support the programming of multi axis numerical machines.
You can create your geometry in VARKON but multi axis machine programming
will have to be done using other software. For less complicated manufacturing
processes though it can surprisingly often be worth the effort to let VARKON
applications generate numerical control data automatically even if this
means extra programming in MBS initially. </P>
