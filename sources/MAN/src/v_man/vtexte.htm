<h3>
Text</h3>
VARKON includes a text entity that can be used in 2D as well as 3D. A text
is a string of maximum 132 characters with starting position and angle
of direction. In MBS it looks like this..
<p><b>text</b>(id,p1,angle,string:attributes);
<p>p1 is the lower left corner of the first character in the string and
angle is the anticlockwise rotation around p1 relative to the X-axis of
the active coordinate system. In a <b>DRAWING MODULE</b> (2D) the text
is always oriented in the plane of the screen but in a <b>GEOMETRY MODULE</b>
a text can be placed in the XY-plane of any coordinate system.
<p>The size, width, slant and font of a text is controlled using attributes.
<b>TSIZE
</b>controls
the height of the text and scales the width accordingly.
<b>TWIDTH</b>
controls the width scaling factor. <b>TSLANT</b> controls the slanting
of individual characters and <b>TFONT</b> sets the basic font to be used.
VARKON includes a normal font and a serif font but other fonts can be created
using a font editor supplied with the system. Since fonts are continuously
scaleable and slantable and can be drawn using any linewidth there is no
need for the large number of fonts often found in other systems. A <b>TPMODE</b>
attribute can be used to control the display orientation of a text in 3D.
With <b>TPMODE</b>=0 the text is alwyays displayed in the plane of the
screen, ie. readable in any view. With <b>TPMODE</b>=1 the text is displayed
in the plane it was originally created in as a true 3D text.
<p>VARKON uses vector representation for its text. When printed or plotted
the boldness of a text will therefore depend on the current penwidth as
well as the <b>TFONT</b> and <b>WIDTH</b> attribute.</ul>
