<H3>Static 2D symbols</H3>

<P>A static symbol is a 2D shape without parametrisation. When a symbol
is inserted on a drawing VARKON uses the name of the symbol to locate a
corresponding symbol file defining the shape of the symbol. If found, VARKON
copies the contents of the file, makes necessary transformations (move,scale,rotate)
and stores the result in its internal database.<BR>
<BR>
VARKON can create and insert symbols in DXF and GKS format. DXF is an industry
standard originating from the AutoCAD system and GKS is an ISO standard
for 2D-graphics. Both are ASCII text formats. DXF can represent geometric
entities like lines, arcs and text but the GKS format only uses polylines.<BR>
<BR>
There are three ways to create a symbol in MBS...<BR>
<BR>
<B>plot_win</B>(p1,p2,filename,origin); ! Plot selected area<BR>
<B>plot_view</B>(viewname,filename); ! Plot named view<BR>
<B>hide_view</B>(viewname,screen and/or file,filename,origin); ! Plot with
hidden lines removed<BR>
<BR>
<B>plot_win</B> and <B>plot_view</B> creates files on DXF or GKS format
depending on the filename parameter. A filename ending with .DXF implies
DXF format and filenames ending with .PLT are used for GKS format.<B> hide_view</B>
creates an image with hidden lines removed and writes the image to a .PLT
file on GKS format. <BR>
<BR>
Symbols on DXF-format are inserted using a MODULE from the system library...<BR>
<BR>
<B>part</B>(id,dxf_in(filename,p1,scale,rotation));<BR>
<BR>
and symbols on GKS format are inserted using....<BR>
<BR>
<B>symb</B>(id,filename,p1,scale,rotation);<BR>
<BR>
In both cases the result is a part with the same name as the file and the
contents of the file as the part members. For DXF files this can be points,
lines, arcs or texts. INSERT-BLOCK is supported but other entities like
PLINE or SOLID are converted to lines and arcs. For GKS files all members
become lines.<BR>
<BR>
Symbols are also used by VARKON for plotting or printing. The VARKON system
includes a large number of hardware specific plotter/printer drivers that
read .PLT or .DXF files and convert the contents to native commands. Popular
drivers are HP7475, HP-CL, Postscript, IBM Proprinter, Epson, Tektronix
etc. The Windows95/NT version of VARKON includes a driver for WIN32 that
can print on any hardware installed under Windows95/NT.</P>
