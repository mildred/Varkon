<h1>Coordinate systems</h1>

<p>
A coordinate system has an origin and three axes, X, Y and Z.
A coordinate system can be activated and will then be displayed
with different size and color than other coordinate systems.
If a coordinate system is active, the plane that includes its
X and Y axes (the XY plane) is also the current working plane.
