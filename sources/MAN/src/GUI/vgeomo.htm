<H3>Geometric modeling basics</H3>

<P>There are numerous ways of creating and using geometry in VARKON. Basic
geometric entities are points, lines, arcs, curves, surfaces, coordinate
systems and transformations. All entities are created using one of several
methods. A line for example, starting in X=0, Y=0, Z=0 and ending in X=100,
Y=0, Z=0 could be created the following way...<BR>
<BR>
<B>lin_free</B>(#1,<B>vec</B>(0,0,0),<B>vec</B>(100,0,0));<BR>
<BR>
The method <B>lin_free</B> indicates that the line is free to go between
any 2 positions in 3D space. In this case the function <B>vec</B>(x,y,z)
is used to express the positions. Other methods are <B>lin_ang, lin_offs,
lin_proj</B>,<B> lin_tan1, lin_tan2</B> and <B>lin_perp</B>. The #1 following
the first left parenthesis is the unique identity we give the line. Suppose
now we want to create a line parallel to #1...<BR>
<BR>
<B>lin_offs</B>(#2,#1,50);<BR>
<BR>
<B>lin_offs</B> creates a new line (#2) offset to an old line (#1) at a
given distance (50). All modeling operations are relative to a currently
active coordinate system. <B>BASIC</B> is the default system but any number
of local coordinate systems can be created at any time and activated in
any order. The following two statements...<BR>
<BR>
<B>csys_1p</B>(#3,&quot;My_system&quot;,<B>vec</B>(25,0,0),0,0,30);<BR>
<B>mode_local</B>(#3);<BR>
<BR>
creates a new coordinate system (#3) in X=25, Y=0, Z=0 rotated 30 degrees
around the Z-axis and gives it the name &quot;My_system&quot;. <B>mode_local</B>
activates the system. The XY-plane in the active coordinate system is used
as the active plane for all operations where a 2D plane is needed. <B>lin_offs</B>
for example always creates a new line placed in the active XY-plane. If
the original line doesn't lie in the active plane then the new line is
made parallel to the projection of the old line into the active plane.<BR>
<BR>
All wire frame entities have a sense of direction. #1 above starts in (0,0,0)
and ends in (100,0,0). Many modeling operations depend on this. <B>lin_offs</B>
for example uses the sense of direction to decide on what side of the old
line to place the new line. If you stand in the starting position of #1
looking towards its end then the right side of the line is treated as positive
and the left side as negative. A distance of plus 50 then places the new
line on the right side while a distance of minus 50 places the new line
on the left side.</P>

<P>The sense of direction for a wireframe object is also used as its parametric
directions. Lines and arcs always have parameters that range from 0 to
1. Their parametrisation is true arclength meaning that a value of 0.5
for example is always the position half way along the entity. Curves have
native parametrisation ranging from 0 to the integer number of segments
they have. A curve with 5 segments will have a parameter that ranges from
0 to 5.</P>

<P>Surfaces and b_planes have two parametric directions, U and V ranging
from 0 to some integer number equal to the number of patches in that direction.
A surface with 2 X 5 patches in U and V will have a parameter U that ranges
from 0 to 2 and V that ranges from 0 to 5. B_planes only have one &quot;patch&quot;
and their parametrisation is always 0 to 1 in both directions.<BR>
<BR>
The idea of an active coordinate system with its XY-plane and entities
with identity and direction is a powerful feature of MBS that helps in
making geometric programming simple and concise.</P>
