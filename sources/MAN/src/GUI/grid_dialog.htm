<h1>The grid dialog</h1>

<p>
In Varkon, you can use a 2D grid to simplify input of positions.
If you display the grid, you will see the grid as a rectangular pattern
of small grey dots. The space between the dots is set in model units.
This means that if you zoom the model you will zoom the grid as well.
You will therefore only see the grid if the display scale is within
reasonable limits. The distance between dots (DX, DY) defaults to 10 mm
in both directions so with the scale set to 1.0 you should have no
problems seeing it.
</p>

<p>
The grid is planar and always oriented in the XY-plane
of the currently active coordinate system. To use the grid, activate the
<code>grid</code> alternative in the lower section of the menu window and
then use the mouse to enter your position. When you press the left mouse
button, Varkon will snap to the closest dot in the grid.
</p>

<p>
In Varkon 1.19 grid is only supported in the old type graphics window
based on X11.
