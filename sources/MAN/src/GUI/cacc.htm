<h1>Curve accuracy</h1>

<p>
Curve accuracy is the same as display tolerance or graphical
approximation error in other systems. It has nothing
to do with the real accuracy of a curve, only it's graphical
appearence. Curves and surfaces in Varkon are probably more accurate
than in most systems including systems that claim that they have
class A surfaces.
</p>

<p>
Systems that display curves do that by approximating the curve
with short lines or vectors (vectorization). The number of vectors
must be kept within reasonable limits or the process will take
too much time. With too few vectors however, the visual effect
is disappointing.

<p>
The pictures above show the same curve with curve accuracy set
to 0.1, 0.5 and 1. As you see, there is a dramatic change in quality
between 0.1 and 1 but higher values would not differ much. This is
due to the fact that Varkon automatically adjusts the length of
the vectors to the curvature of the curve and that the display
itself has a limited resolution.
</p>

<p>
Default value for curve accuracy is 1. The smallest value you can use
is 0.1 and the biggest is 100. The default value usually works fine
but if you need to display curves with more vectors it is usually
enough to increase the value to 2 or 3. Varkon automatically increases
the curve accuracy 3 times when plotfiles  (*.PLT) are created. This
means that a printout on paper is usually smoother than the same image
on the display.
</p>

<p>
Curve accuracy controls the display of arcs and curves. It also controls
the curves used to display a surface in wireframe mode. When surfaces
are shaded with light and color Varkon uses the curve accuracy factor
to control the number of triangles used for the shading process.

<p>
The pictures above show the same surface shaded with a curve accuracy
of 1 and 3 respectively. Be carful to increase this value too much if
you don't have a very powerful graphics display card.
