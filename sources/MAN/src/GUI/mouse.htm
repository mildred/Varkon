<h1>The mouse</h1>

<p>
Varkon assumes a mouse with three buttons. The left button is
always used to make selections and the right button is used to quit the
current operation (or return to the previous menu). The middle button is
used to pan, zoom and rotate the model in OpenGL graphics windows. It can
also be used to quit the current operation and return directly back to the
main menu. A mouse with only two buttons usually emulates a middle button
by pressing the two buttons at the same time. A mouse with a scrollwheel
may let you press the scrollwheel and that will work as the middle button.
</p>

<p>
Many operations use of the mouse to select or outline something in a
graphics window. The ZOOM-operation for example, where you first press
the left button, then move the mouse with the button still down and
finally release the button. Entity selection is another example where you
use the mouse and its left button to select an entity. Whenever Varkon
wants you to use the mouse in a graphics window the shape of the cursor
changes from the normal pointer to a crosshair. You can press F1 or
&lt;CTRL&lt;a while the cursor is in crosshair mode to get help as usual.

<p>
The configuration of mouse buttons is currently hard coded within Varkon
and can not be controlled by ini-files or similar.
