<h1>Part</h1>

<p>
The part is a composite entity with the ability to host any number
of other entities including other parts. A part reminds of a symbol,
block or feature in other CAD-systems but a part is not a static
object with predefined appearence. Parts are defined by modules and
parameters. As modules are actually computer programs, parts are
very dynamic.
</p>

<p>
Any module (except MACRO modules) may be used to create a part. The
module attribute will influence how the part is oriented in 3D space.
A BASIC module will create a part oriented relative to the BASIC
coordinate system. A GLOBAL module will create a part oriented relative
to the coordinate system of the caller and a LOCAL module will create
a part oriented relative to a LOCAL (user created) coordinate system.

<h2>Methods</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="../MBS/part.htm">Part</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
You can create parts in explicit and generic mode but if
you want to create a module you must be in generic mode.
</p>

<p>
When a part is created you can edit it's parameters and Varkon will
automatically update the part by reexecuting the module that created
the part with the new parameters.

See also the <a href="../MBS/symb.htm">symbol</a> entity for a simple
way to work with 2D static symbols.
