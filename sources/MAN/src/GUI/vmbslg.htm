<H3>The MBS language</H3>

<P>MBS is based on a general purpose programming language with syntax
 reminding of PASCAL. An executing unit is called a MODULE in MBS. 
This is conceptually the same as a program, subroutine or procedure
 in other languages. MBS is a general purpose programming language but
 at the same time also a generic (parametric) language for Design and Product
 Modeling. To give you a first idea of what MBS looks like here's 
a simple example....

          MACRO MODULE count_lines(STRING filename*80 &gt;&quot;Enter name of file !&quot;);

          STRING line*132;

          INT    count;

             line:=inlin(f);

          !***If a line was read increase counter and loop again.
          !*
             IF iostat(f) = 0 THEN
             count:=count + 1;

          !*
          !***If no line was read there are no more lines to read. Close the file and
          !***display the result in a VARKON listwindow.

</B>This module counts the number of lines in a file and displays the result in a window. As you see from the first line a module is always declared with type, name and optional parameters. If called by another module the calling module would have to provide a filename but if called interactively (by a human) the module would halt and prompt for a filename before continuing.</PRE>
