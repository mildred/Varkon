<h1>The menu window</h1>

<p>
The menu window is automatically created when a job is started
and persists until you exit Varkon. It is divided into three parts.
The upper part changes when you make menu selections. The two lower
parts are always the same.
</p>

<h2>The upper part</h2>

<p>
The upper part is used to display menu alternatives. When you select an alternative
from a menu (by leftclicking the mouse or entering the first letter(s)
from the keyboard) a new menu is displayed. The new menu persits until
you make a new selection or return to the previous menu by pressing the
right mouse button anywhere in the menu window or the RETURN key on the
keyboard.
</p>

<p>
You can click the middle mouse button anywhere in the menu window or press
the TAB key on the keyboard at any time to return directly to Varkon's main
menu.
</p>

<h2>The middle part</h2>

<p>
The middle part of the menu window is used to access some of the more
common functions in Varkon.
</p>

<h2>The lower part</h2>

<p>
The lower part of the menu window is used to select which method
to use when you enter a position. The rel button changes the behaviour
of the other buttons by adding a relative distance.
</p>

<h2>More information about menus</h2>

<p>
You can alter the default position of the menu window by creating your
own ini file. See the <a href="../sysadm/ini_files.htm"> Ini-files section</a>
of the System administrators manual and the <a href="../appdev/inifiles.htm">
Ini-files section</a> of the Application developers manual.
</p>

<p>
The menus displayed in the menu window are defined in external text files.
See the <a href="../appdev/MDFsyntax.htm"> Menu files section</a>  of the
Application developers manual for more information on menu files.
</p>

<p>
Some of Varkons menus have their own documentation pages. You can access
the doc page of a menu by pressing F1 or &lt;CTRL&gt;a while the menu is
visible in the menu window.
