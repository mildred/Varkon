<h1>Messages</h1>

<p>
The lower part of graphic viewing windows is used by Varkon to
display messages. You can also use it to enter the name of a
MACRO module that you want to execute. Each message is displayed
with a green, blue or red dot. There are three kinds of messages.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Information, green color</li>
<li>Prompts, blue color</li>
<li>Errors, red color</li>
</ul>

<p>
Informational messages are usually output to confirm that
something has been done. Promts are used to inform the user
that something needs to be done. Error messages are issued
when something is wrong.

The picture above shows the default configuration of the message area.
Three informational messages are displayed. The last message in
black color and the previous in grey.

You can increase the size of the message area in order to view more
messages if you want to. Messages are listed with the oldest message
first (highest up) and the most recent message at the bottom of the
list.
