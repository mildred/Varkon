Basic surface representations</h3>
VARKON supports several basic types of parametric surfaces. The first is
the common bicubic parametric surface <b>CUB_SUR</b>. This surface can
be used to interpolate positions and tangents or it can be used to approximate
other surfaces. Due to the fact that many other systems also support the
bicubic it is also well suited for import and export of surface data. VARKON
also supports the rational form of the bicubic, <b>RAT_SUR</b>.
<p>The second type of surface is a special type of conic lofting surface
implemented in Varkon by G. Liden for SAAB Military Aircraft. <b>LFT_SUR</b>
is based on the idea of a varying conic section moving along some curves
while generating or sweeping the surface. 5 curves of any type are used
to control the shape of each conic in the section and a 6:th curve called
the spine is used to control how the section moves.
<p><b>LFT_SUR</b> is a surface of extremely high quality with a lot of
built in smoothness. It is also very flexible since its mathematical formulation
is totally independent of the mathematical representation of the defining
curves. Any curves can be used, splines, conics, offsets or UV-curves.
<p>Next surface type is the <b>NURBS</b> surface. NURBS <b>surfaces</b>
can be created in MBS by specifying the control polygon or imported from
external files or created by approximation of a surface of other type.
<p>VARKON also includes a faceted surface. <b>FAC_SUR</b> is used to approximate
other surfaces. Each patch in the surface is a planar triangle with the
same property as a B-plane. This means that faceted surfaces can be used
to produce images with hidden lines automatically removed. <b>FAC_SUR</b>
can also be used to produce approximations suited for export to other systems.
<p>An offset surface <b>sur_offs</b> is implemented in much the same way
as the offset curve <b>cur_offs</b>. An offset surface is not a surface
type of its own but rather an ordinary extension to any other surface.
As for curves this means that no approximation is involved in the evaluation
of an offset surface. VARKON does it the hard way by first evaluating the
original surface and then "add" the offset.
<p>The default graphical representation of a surface is based on four solid
boundary curves and two dashed mid curves. The <b>SDASHL</b> attribute
can be used to control the dashlength for the 2 mid curves. The VARKON
shading functions based on OpenGL can be used to produce more realistic
images of surfaces when required.
<p>VARKON is a system based on a true parametric evaluator. This is important
for the quality of different algorithms and also for the possibility of
adding new curve and surface representations in the future. This has already
been done at SAAB Military Aircraft with very good results. A new surface
type was implemented in only a few days with practically no changes to
existing code. A new evaluation routine was added of course but old routines
for intersects, closest point, graphics and so on did not need any changes.</ul>
