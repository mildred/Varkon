<H3>The Conic Lofting surface</H3>

<P>A major problem in surface modeling is often that the number of constraints
you impose on the shape of a surface is larger than the mathematical representation
of the surface really accepts. A simple bicubic patch for example is uniquely
defined by 48 numbers and nothing more. If this amount of freedom is not
enough to describe a certain shape you can either use more patches or you
can raise the order of the basic polynomial from 3 to 5 or even higher
or you can use rational polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
None of these solutions are particularly good however. Defining a surface
with many patches requires more data and increases the risk of introducing
oscillations or other errors. Raising the order of the polynomial is a
well documented way of introducing oscillations and unstable numerical
behavior. Rational polynomials are better then non rational but the difference
is relatively small.<BR>
<BR>
The VARKON Conic Lofting surface was developed with many years of bad experience
from current modeling techniques in mind and is therefore based on a completely
new concept. The representation of <B>LFT_SUR</B> is analytically defined
by a section of parametric rational cubic segments in the V-direction and
by a procedural method in the U-direction. Each conic in the section is
controlled by 2 limit curves, 2 tangent curves and a midpoint curve or
P-value curve (MP). The 6:th curve is called the spine.<BR>
<BR>
<B>sur_conic</B>(id,spine,lim1,tan1,mpflag1,MP1,lim2,tan2.......limn,tann);<BR>
<BR>
To evaluate the surface VARKON first uses the parametric U-value to calculate
a corresponding position on the spine and then sets up a plane with the
spine tangent as normal. The plane is then used to intersect the 5 curves
that define the conic and use this data to create the conic which in the
end is evaluated for the parametric V-value. The result is a surface that
has the characteristics of the conic in the V-direction and the characteristics
of the limit and tangent curves in the U-direction. The spine controls
the parametrisation in the V-direction.<BR>
<BR>
Surfaces based on <B>LFT_SUR</B> are automatically smooth in the U-direction
since a conic can not oscillate. The quality of the surface in the V-direction
depends on the shape of the limiting curves but is independent of their
parametrisation. This gives the <B>LFT_SUR</B> a large amount of built
in smoothness. <B>LFT_SUR</B> also has a unique degree of freedom to be
formed with a minimum of input data. A <B>CUB_SUR</B> may need 100 patches
or more to approximate the shape of one <B>LFT_SUR</B> patch within acceptable
limits. <BR>
<BR>
Evaluation of a <B>LFT_SUR</B> can require heavy computations but saves
a lot of memory compared to traditional surfaces. </P>
