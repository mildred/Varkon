<h1>MBO- and RES-files, what's the difference ?</h1>

<p>
As a beginner, the easiest way to get started
with Varkon is probably by using the system in explicit mode.
In explicit mode you create and edit RES-files, similar to the
files created by many other CAD systems.
</p>

<p>
Using Varkon in generic mode will give you access to more
advanced modeling techniques. In generic mode you create and edit
MBO-files.
</p>

<h2>Generic and explicit</h2>

<p>
Generic is Latin for family and a generic model is thus a model that
describes not only a single member of the family but the entire family
in more general terms. A generic screw for example, has all the properties
of a screw but no specific length or diameter. A screw with specific length
and diameter (a member of the family) is an explicit screw. In object oriented
terminology <i><b>generic</b></i> and <i><b>explicit</b></i> translate to
<i><b>class</b></i> and <i><b>instance</b></i>.
</p>

<p>
In generic mode you create generic models but Varkon automatically also
creates and updates an explicit model. This process is called evaluation....
</p>

<p>
You create a generic model ---&gt; Automatic evaluation ---&gt; Explicit model
</p>

<p>
Another way to understand the process is to think of the generic model
as a computer program that creates a drawing when you run it.
</p>

<p>
Program ---&gt; Run ---&gt; Drawing
</p>

<p>
A Varkon program is called a module and is stored on disc as a MBO-file.
When you load a module and run it, Varkon automatically creates the
corresponding explicit model and stores it in a RES-file.
</p>

<p>
In explicit mode you create and edit RES-files directly. Since you can then only
model one member of the family at the time, explicit modeling is more direct and
therefore easier to learn. If you need to model many members of a family,
generic modeling will save a lot of time. In some applications you will
probably want to use both methods in combination. You can use Varkon
in generic mode to create modules and then use explicit mode to run them and
add or edit the result.
</p>

<h2>The MBS modeling language</h2>

<p>
The generic model is based on the MBS modeling language which is unique
to the Varkon system. Parameters are used to model things that differ between
members of a family and a module with statements is used to model
common properties. The MBS language is documented in
<a href="../MBS/index.htm">the MBS programmers manual.</a>
</p>

<p>
MBS is not only the basic representation of a generic model. It can also
be used to create one! A macro module written in MBS can automatically add,
update, delete and reevaluate a generic model.
</p>

<p>
You create macro module ---&gt; Generic model ---&gt; Evaluation ---&gt; Explicit model
