<H3>f106 Activate local coordinate system</H3>

<P><B>Description<BR>
<BR>
</B>Makes a local coordinate system become the currently active coordinate
system. Coordinates and angles entered are always relative to the currently
active coordinate system.<BR>
<BR>
There are three levels of coordinate systems in VARKON. The big coordinate
system in which all other systems are defined is referred to as BASIC.
The BASIC system is not stored anywhere or displayed but all geometry in
the GM-database is stored in BASIC coordinates.<BR>
<BR>
Each module also has a GLOBAL system of its own wich is automatically activated
when the module is called and executed. Depending on the module attribute
this can be one of the following. A BASIC module has the BASIC coordinate
system as its GLOBAL system. A GLOBAL module inherits the GLOBAL system
of the calling module and a LOCAL module uses a LOCAL system (specified
in the calling part statement) as its GLOBAL. The active (topmost) module
always has BASIC as its GLOBAL system.<BR>
<BR>
LOCAL coordinate systems are those created by the user, see f14 and f104.<BR>
