<h1>The Level dialog</h1>

<p>
Each entity in Varkon belongs to a specific level (or layer).
Graphic viewing windows can display any combinations of up to
2000 individual layers and you use the level dialog to control
which levels to display. When a new window is created all levels
are visible by default. You can then blank or unblank levels as
you wish individually in each window. This means that you can
display different combinations of levels in different windows.
</p>

<p>
You can name a level if you want to. This way it is easier to
remember which type of information that belongs to a specific
level. If you give a name to a level the same name will be
used for this level in all graphics windows.
</p>

<p>
The upper part of the level dialog is used to list the status
of a selected range of levels. The default behaviour is to start
with level 0 and then list as many additional levels as will fit
in the window. To list another range of levels, enter the range 
in the range input field as first-last (no spaces) and
press <code>Apply</code>. If you enter 5-10 for example, and press
<code>Apply</code>, level 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will be selected.
</p>

<p>
For each level in the list you can enter a name. You can also blank
or unblank (display) the level by pressing the plus or minus button
to the right of the name. In the example above, 15 levels are listed.
The first 4 levels have names and all levels are visible except level
2 and 3.
</p>

<p>
You can also select a range by entering a name in the name input field
and pressing <code>Apply</code>. Names may be entered using wildcards.
The default value is * which is equal to all levels (that have names).
El* will list all levels with a name starting with letters El etc.
Other valid combinations are *text and *text*.
</p>

<p>
Use <code>All used</code> to list all levels that are used in the current
model.
</p>

<p>
To close the view dialog press <code>Close</code>.
To display this help press <code>Help</code>
