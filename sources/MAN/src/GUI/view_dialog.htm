<h1>The view dialog</h1>

<p>
In Varkon you can rotate your model and view it from different directions
in all three dimensions. The view dialog is used to rotate the model
into a specific orientation and (optionally) save that view with a name. In
the OpenGL graphics window you can also rotate your model using the middle
mouse button. The view dialog has 3 sections, see below.
</p>

<h2>The upper section</h2>

<p>
The upper section lists all currently defined views. The first 8 views are
created automatically when you start a new job. In the example above the
user has added two views, My_view-1 and My_view-2. The xy button is highlighted
because the xy view is active. If you press another button that view is 
displayed instead.
</p>

<h2>The middle section</h2>

<p>
The middle section includes functions to rotate the model and save or delete views.
Use the <code>Coordinate system</code> button to select a coordinate system in
your model. Varkon will then rotate the model so that the Z-axis of the selected
coordinate system becomes the viewing direction. Use <code>Camera position</code>
to specify any viewing position. Note that in the OpenGL graphics window you can
also rotate your model using the middle mouse button.
</p>

<p>
To save the current view, enter the name you want to use in the name field and
press <code>Save as</code>. To delete a view, enter the name of the view you want
to delete and press <code>Delete view</code>.
</p>

<h2>The bottom section</h2>

<p>
To close the view dialog press <code>Close</code>.
To display this help press <code>Help</code>
