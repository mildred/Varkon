<h1>List windows</h1>

<p>
List windows are output only windows used by Varkon to
display text output in various situations. Default position
etc. of list windows is controlled by the ini file. You can
print the contents of a list window or save it to disc by right
clicking in the list window. You can also create list windows of
your own with MBS.
