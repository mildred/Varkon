<h1>Import and export</h1>

<h2>DXF</h2>

<p>
The DXF format was originally defined as a DrawingeXchangeFormat
for AutoCAD but is now widley used to exchange 2D geometry between
systems of various kinds. DXF also has support for simple 3D geometry.
Varkon supports import of DXF files through a module library, see
VARKON_ROOT/sources/Vlib/dxf. Import is limited to support only the
most common entities and attributes of the DXF specification.
</p>

<p>
Varkon DXF export supports all Varkon entities. Varkon entities
that are not supported by the DXF specification are converted to
the DXF POLYLINE entity.
</p>


<h2>IGES</h2>

<p>
The ANSI IGES format is supported by most CAD systems, primarily for
import and export of 3D wireframe and surface geometry. Varkon supports
import of IGES files through a module library. See the README_IGES
in VARKON_ROOT/sources/Vlib/iges for more info on the IGES import library.
</p>

<p>
Varkon does not support IGES export.
</p>

<h2>STL</h2>

<p>
STL was originally defined as a file format for rapid prototyping using
STereoLitografy. It is a simple 3D format limited to plane triangular
facets. Varkon supports import of STL files in text or binary format.
Each facet in the STL file is mapped to a b_plane in Varkon.
</p>

<p>
Varkon supports export of b_planes, facet surfaces and mesh
entities on STL text format.
</p>

<h2>PLT</h2>

<p>
The PLT format is used by Varkon primarily for printing and plotting
but can also be used for static 2D symbols. The PLT format conforms
to the ISO GKS Metafile format specification for 2D vector graphics.
Varkon supports export of all entities on PLT format.
</p>

<p>
Varkon supports import of PLT files through the MBS SYMB() procedure.
