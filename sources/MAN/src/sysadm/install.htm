<h1>Download and installation</h1>

<p>
The Varkon system is hosted by SourceForge, the world's
largest Open Source software development web site. This
is the address to the home page of SourceForge:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net">http://sourceforge.net</a>
</p>

<p>
To download Varkon, go to the Varkon project site on SourceForge:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/varkon">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/varkon</a>
</p>

<p>
From he Varkon project site on SourceForge you can download different
versions of Varkon, You can also read news, post bug reports or feature
requests and participate in a discussion on the forum. Varkon is available
either as a package or through SVN. In both cases there are several options.
</p>

<h2>Downloading a Varkon package</h2>

<p>
A package is a compressed file that includes all files needed to install
Varkon. You can select between a binary package or a source package. The
easiest way to go is the binary package since it is prebuilt for a specific
platform and there is no need to compile the sources. If there is no binary
package that suits your platform you will have to download the source package
and build the system on your own computer. Each package has a version composed
of two numbers and a letter, 1.19B for example. Packaged versions are released
on a regular basis one or two times per year. When you browse the Varkon project
site on SourceForge you will see that you can download the latest version
of the system as well as older versions.
</p>

<h2>Installing a Varkon package</h2>

<p>
Installing a package is very easy. After downloading the
compressed file, just unpack it in the location where you want
the system installed, any directory will do. If you have an earlier
version of Varkon installed you can use the same directory but we
recommend that you install a new version in a new directory.
</p>

<p>
All files in the package will be placed in a subdirectory with the
name of the current version. This directory becomes the root-directory
of your installation and is called VARKON_ROOT. If you install
Varkon version 1.19B in <code>/home/username</code>, then VARKON_ROOT becomes:<br>
<pre class=box>
  /home/username/varkon_1.19B
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The idea with this installation procedure is to make it
possible to install new versions of Varkon at any time
without interfearing with previously installed versions.
This way you can easily switch between two versions if you
like to.
</p>

<p>
If the package you have installed is a binary package, you
are now ready to start the system for the first time. If you
have installed a source package you must first build the
system. How to build the system is described in the README-file
located in <code>$VARKON_ROOT/sources</code>. How to start the system is
described in the <a href="./start.htm">Start Varkon</a>
section of this manual.
</p>


<h2>Downloading Varkon through SVN</h2>

<p>
It is also possible to download sources from the SVN repository.
The SVN repository contains the latest developments of the sources,
sometimes not fully tested or documented and sometimes not with
support for all platforms but usually with more functionality
than what is availabe in the latest package. The sources in the
SVN repository are updated by the Varkon development team without
notice. Each update gets a new SVN version number. You can use the
SVN Browse tool on the Varkon project site on Sourceforge to read
the update logs. To download the Varkon sources from the SVN
repository you need to have the Subversion package (svn) installed
on your computer.
</p>

<h2>Uninstalling Varkon</h2>

<p>
If you want to remove a Varkon installation the only thing
you need to do is to remove its root directory. All files
included in the package will then be removed.
