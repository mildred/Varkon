<h1>Environment variables</h1>

<p>
Varkon depends on the values of a number of Varkon specific environment
variables. Each variable either points to a single file or to the location
of a group of files needed by Varkon to operate correctly. Normally, these
environment variables are set up by the Varkon start script. The default
start script sets up an environment that will work but it is usual among
Varkon users to use customized versions of the defult start script with
some of the environment variables changed to meet specific needs. See below
for the full list of all environment variables used by Varkon and how they
influence the system.
</p>


<h2>VARKON_ROOT</h2>

<p>
This is the first variable set by the start script. It points to the place
where the Varkon system is installed and is basically used to define other
environment variables. At start up, Varkon checks for the existence of
VARKON_ROOT. If VARKON_ROOT is not defined, Varkon will issue an error
message to the console (stdout) and exit. For mor information about
VARKON_ROOT, see <a href="./start_script.htm">The start script</a> section
of this manual.
</p>

<h2>VARKON_LIB</h2>

<p>
Modules (MBO-files) are essential to Varkon. Users create modules and
many interactive functions are implemented using (macro) modules.
When a module is called, Varkon searches the current job_directory,
then  <code>job_directory/lib</code> and if not found, Varkon uses the value of
VARKON_LIB to search additional directories. VARKON_LIB may define
up to 10 different directories separated by colon. Directories are
searched in the order they appear until a module is found. In a
sense, VARKON_LIB reminds of the PATH environment variable used by
many operating systems to find the location of executable files.
</p>

<p>
In the default start script, VARKON_LIB points to the system module
library. If you add additional directories to VARKON_LIB it is
important not to remove the system library. Here is a section
from a start script that shows how to use VARKON_LIB.
</p>

<pre class=box>
VARKON_LIB=$VARKON_ROOT/lib
export VARKON_LIB

# The following line is an example that includes
# an additional directory.
# VARKON_LIB=/home/username/my_library:$VARKON_ROOT/lib
</pre>

<p>
For more information on VARKON_LIB, see also the following sections:<br>
<a href="../appdev/modlibs.htm">Module libraries</a><br>
<a href="../appdev/macro_varkon.htm">Where should I keep my macros ?</a>
</p>

<h2>VARKON_MDF</h2>

<p>
Varkon uses the value of VARKON_MDF to find the menu file (MDF-file) to
load at start up. Sooner or later you may want to change VARKON_MDF to
point to a menu file of your own. See the <a href="../appdev/MDFsyntax.htm">Menu files</a>
section for more information about menu files.
</p>

<h2>VARKON_ERM</h2>

<p>
Varkon internally uses an error message system based on error codes
composed of two letters and 4 digits. The two letters relate to the
source code module involved. The first 3 digits form the actual error
number, and the last digit is a severity code. Varkon uses the text
files in the directory pointed to by VARKON_ERM to map internal error
codes to text messages. Each source code module has an error message
file (ERM-file) of its own. You should normally not need to alter the
value of VARKON_ERM but you could for example change it to point to a
custom set of ERM-files that you have translated into another language.
</p>

<h2>VARKON_DOC</h2>

<p>
This is the top directory for the Varkon documentation and the files
used by the Varkon interactive context sensitive help system. Unless
you want to replace the Varkon documentation with something else, you
should not need to edit VARKON_DOC. To display help and documentation
correctly Varkon also relies on the settings of the "html_viewer"
resource in the ini-file.

<p><a href="../appdev/docs.htm">Application specific documentation</a></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><a href="../GUI/f153.htm">Varkon context sensitive help system</a></p>

<h2>VARKON_TMP</h2>

<p>
Varkon uses the value of VARKON_TMP as the location for temporary
files. By default, it points to <code>VARKON_ROOT/tmp</code> which is a directory
included in the Varkon installation. You may want to change VARKON_TMP
to point to a system wide directory like <code>/tmp</code> or <code>C:/TEMP</code>
or you may want each user to have an individual temp directory.
</p>

<p>
Varkon users only need read access to most of the files in the Varkon installation
but note that all Varkon users must have <b>read and write</b> access to VARKON_TMP.
</p>

<p>
Under normal circumstances Varkon automatically removes a temporary
file when it's not needed but there are occasions when temporary
files are left in VARKON_TMP. This may cause VARKON_TMP to grow as time
goes. Should any files be found in the location pointed to by VARKON_TMP
when Varkon is not running it is suggested you delete them.
</p>

<h2>VARKON_FNT</h2>

<p>
This environment variable is used by Varkon to locate files with fonts for
vector based graphical text. Varkon by default includes a number of fonts
(see the TEXT statement in MBS). Font 0 is the default when a new job is
started. This font is hardcoded and has no font file. The rest of the
fonts are defined in <code>*.FNT</code> files in VARKON_FNT. These files are not
loaded until they are used for the first time but then stays loaded in
memory until Varkon terminates.
</p>

<p>
Fonts 0 to 9 are reserved by the system. The font editor included in the Varkon
system can be used to defines custom fonts. Such fonts should have names beginning
at <code>10.FNT</code> and up until <code>20.FNT</code> and also reside in the
location pointed to by VARKON_FNT. It should not be nessecary under normal
circumstances to use another value of VARKON_FNT than the default.
</p>

<h2>VARKON_PLT</h2>

<p>
This variable is used by Varkon to find the plotter configuration
file (plot.cnf) used to set the output scale etc. for interactive
printing. plot.cnf is also updated automatically when you use the
configure alternative in the print dialog.
</p>

<p>
It is not a bad idea to change VARKON_PLT to point to a location
outside the Varkon installation file tree. If so, place a copy of
the default file in that location and then configure your printer
interactively. This way your plotter settings will persist if a new
version of Varkon is installed.
</p>

<p>
Note also that all Varkon users must have <b>read and write</b> access
to VARKON_PLT.
</p>

<h2>VARKON_ICO</h2>

<p>
VARKON_ICO is used by Varkon to locate icon files used by the user
interface. Although VARKON_ICO may be changed to point to another
location this should normally not be nessecary.
</p>

<h2>VARKON_TOL</h2>

<p>
VARKON_TOL is used by Varkon to locate the file <code>surpac.tol</code>. This
file is loaded at startup and defines the tolerances used in many
geometric calculations. If you need to change any of the
values in <code>surpac.tol</code>, put the changed version of the file somewhere
outside the Varkon installation file tree and edit VARKON_TOL to
point to the new location. This way your changes to <code>surpac.tol</code> will
persist when Varkon is updated to a new version.
</p>

<h2>VARKON_INI</h2>

<p>
VARKON_INI is used in the start script to point to the location for
the default Varkon ini-file. There is normally no reason to change or
add anything to the default ini-file but you can create a custom
ini-file of your own and instruct Varkon to load it "on top" of the
default file. Settings in the custom file will then override settings
in the default file. You can put a custom ini-file anywhere you like,
Varkon only uses VARKON_INI to locate the default ini-file.
</p>

<p>
There is more information on ini-files in the <a href="../appdev/inifiles.htm">
Ini-files</a> section of the Application developers manual.
</p>

<h2>VARKON_BIN</h2>

<p>
This is the place for the Varkon executables. It is used by
the start scrip to start the main Varkon executable but also
by Varkon to execute the Varkon compiler (mbsc) and
the Varkon plotter driver specified in <code>VARKON_PLT/plot.cnf</code>.
