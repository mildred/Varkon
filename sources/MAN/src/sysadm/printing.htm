<h1>Printing and plotting</h1>

<p>
Printing (or plotting as it is sometimes called) is a three step
process. The first step is to create a 2D vectorbased image
of the model on ISO/GKS Metafile format. In Varkon, such files
are called plotfiles and have names that end with .PLT. The second
step is to process the plotfile into a format that
is known by a specific printer or plotter. To do this, Varkon
uses a separate small program called plotterdriver. Varkon
plotterdrivers read their input from standard input (stdin) and
write their output to standard output (stdout) so you can use
the as a filter if you wnat to. The most comonly driver used is
postscript but special drivers for less common hardware also exist.
The third and last step is to send the processed data to a printer
or plotter. This is usually done by involving the printer manager
of the computer system used, typically lp on a Unix platform,
see below.
</p>

<p>
The print dialog in the graphic window creates a plotfile
automatically. Depending on what portion of the model and
what view direction you have selected a PLT-file of that
selection is automatically created in VARKON_TMP. (You can
also create PLT-files with the file/export/PLT-function or
with MBS).
</p>

<p>
In order to process the plotfile and send it to its final destination,
the print dialog in the graphic window uses settings from
a printer configuration file (plot.cnf) located in VARKON_PLT.
Here is a printout of the default plot.cnf
</p>

<pre>
Varkon_driver:postscript -bw -FF
Unix_print_command: | lp
Media_size_x: 210
Media_size_y: 296
Xmin: 0
Ymin: 0
Rotation: 0
Scale: 1
Autofit: True
</pre>

<p>
The first line specifies which driver to use and optional command line
parameters to send to the driver. -bw in this case means use_black_and_white
color mapping (the most commonly used printers are balck_and_white). -FF makes
the driver add a FormFeed character to the end of the output. The name of the
plotfile is added automatically. The second line specifies the command needed
to send the output from the driver to it's final destination. The rest of
the information in the configuration file is used to calculate the scale
and orientation of the output. Depending on the settings in the configuration
file Varkon will create a suitable shell command and send it to the operating
system to process without wait. Assuming a temporary plotfile a6freg.PLT has
been created in VARKON_TMP, this is what the Unix command line would look
like:
</p>

<pre>
($VARKON_BIN/postscript &lt;$VARKON_TMP/a6freg.PLT -bw -FF -s1 -v0 -x0 -y0 | lp;rm $VARKON_TMP/a6freg.PLT)&
</pre>

<p>
To alter the settings in the configuration file, use the configure alternative
in the print dialog. If, for example, you want to save the processed output in
a file rather than send it to a printer, change the Unix_print_comand: to >filename.
An option for users of the KDE environment is to replace lp with kprinter.

<h2>Varkon printer drivers</h2>

<p>
The Varkon system includes a few different printer drivers.
The postscript driver is defalt on Unix systems. With this
driver (in combination with ghostscript) Varkon should be
able to print on all printers supported by the Unix system
where Varkon is installed. Varkon also includes drivers
for Hewlett Packard plotters and Microsoft windows.
