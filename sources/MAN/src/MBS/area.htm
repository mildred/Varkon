<h1>area - Function</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
Returns the area projected on the active XY-plane by of a planar region bounded
by any combination of lines, arcs or curves. Optional interior holes or islands
are excluded. Accuracy is controlled by a step parameter.
</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<pre>
  a:=area(step, id_1, id_2....id_n);

  float a;
  float step;
  ref   id_1, id_2...id_n;
</pre>

<h2>Principal parameters</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<td>step</td>
<td>- Step length for numerical accuracy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>id_1</td>
<td>- Identity of first line, arc or curve in boundary.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Optional parameters</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<td>id_2...id_n</td>
<td>- Identity of additional lines, arcs or curves in exterior
or interior boundary.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Return value</h2>

<p>
A FLOAT value equal to the calculated area.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre>
  a:=area(0.01, #4, #5, #19);

  ! Calculates the area bounded by #4, #5 and #19. Step length is set to 0.01.
</pre>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>
The area is computed by numerical integration along the positive X-axis
in steps equal to parameter step. A small value for step gives a more accurate
result but takes longer time to compute. For a circle with radius = 1 a
step of 0.1 gives an area = 3.15. A step of 0.01 gives an area of 3.1419.
The exact area is PI = 3.1415927
</p>

<p>
Boundary entities can be specified in any order of choice but must form
one or more well defined boundaries where all entities in each boundary
are connected in their endpoints. If more than one boundary is defined
one of them must enclose all the other. Boundaries should not cross or
touch each other.
</p>

<p>
Before the calculation starts, the boundary is projected to the XY-plane of
the currently active coordinate system. It is thus possible to create the
boundary in one plane and calculate the area of the projection in another
not neccesarily parallell plane.
