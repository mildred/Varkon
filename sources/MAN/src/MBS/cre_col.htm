<h1>cre_color - Procedure</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
Sets the RGB color value for a pen. Pen numbers range from 0 to 255. Pen 0 is used for
background in graphics windows and pen 1 is the default pen for drawing. Pen 0 and 1 are
always defined in Varkon's resource- or ini-file. Additional pens may be defined there as
well but usually not all 256.
</p>

<p>
cre_color() can be used by a module to create or change a large number of pen colors
automatically. It is good advice however not to change the default RGB values of pen 0 and
1.
</p>

<p>
A pen color is defined by mixing different intensities of Red, Green and Blue color (RGB).
No intensity is 0 and full intensity is 255. This gives what is often referred to as 24
bits of color or True Color. If the hardware of the computer does not support true color
Varkon uses the closest match to the desired color.

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<pre>
  cre_color(pen, red, green, blue);

  int pen;
  int red;
  int green;
  int blue;
</pre>

<h2>Principal parameters</h2>

<table>

<tr>
<td>pen</td>
<td>- Pen number. 2 - 255</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>red</td>
<td>- Red intensity, 0 - 255</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>green</td>
<td>- Green intensity, 0 - 255</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>blue</td>
<td>- Blue intensity, 0 - 255</td>
</tr>

</table>

<h2>Optional parameters</h2>

<p>None.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>
Colors may look different on different computers due to differences in hardware. Varkon
uses the specified RGB-triplet as it is without gamma correction.
