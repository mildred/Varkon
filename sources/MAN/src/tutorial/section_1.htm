<h1>Modules and RES-files</h1>

<p>
Varkon is used to create gemetric models. Some people may
call them parts, drawings or just models. There are also
different types of models, 2D, 3D, wireframe, surface and solid
and so on. In Varkon you can create 2D and 3D wireframe and
surface models and you can do it in two ways:
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>
Directly. This is called <b><i>explicit</i></b> modeling. The result will be a RES-file.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Indirectly, by first creating a module and then let the module create the RES-file.
This is called <b><i>generic</i></b> modeling. The result will be a MBO-file (module) and a RES-file.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The first method is the easiest to learn. The second method takes a little
longer, but once there you will be able to do much more. This tutorial
will show you how to use Varkon in <b><i>generic</i></b> mode. Doing so, you will also
learn a lot about <b><i>explicit</i></b> modeling.
