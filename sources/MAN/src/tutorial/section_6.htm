<h1>Save and exit</h1>

<p>
From the main menu, select file/save/exit. Varkon now saves
your module in a file named "my_first_job.MBO". It is placed
in the directory you chose as your job directory when you started
this tutorial (/home/jkr/varkon_jobs). The result created by your
module is saved in a file named "my_first_job.RES".
</p>

<p>
Since "my_first_job.RES" is automatically created by
"my_first_job.MBO" you actually don't need to save it, but
Varkon does this by default. If you remove your RES-file,
Varkon will automatically create a new RES-file next time
you start the job. You can also use Varkon in explicit mode
to load an existing RES-file and make changes to it.

This ends the Varkon 6 min tutorial. For more information,
