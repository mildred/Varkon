<h1>Create some entities</h1>

<p>
When Varkon is started, you will see two windows. One
is the menu window. The upper part of the menu window
is dynamic and shows the currently active menu. The rest
of the menu window is static and never changes.
</p>

<p>
From the menu window, select <code>create</code>. A new menu will then
be presented with different things to create. Then select <code>point</code>
and finally select <code>free</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now, move the mouse to the graphic window and create a point by pressing
the left mouse button. Move the mouse and create one more point. Finally,
with the mouse still in the graphic window, press the right mouse button.
This will end the <code>create/point/free</code> function and make you return to
menu mode. Your graphic window will show two points.
</p>

<p>
Next step is to connect the two points with a straight line. Move the
mouse back to the menu window and press the middle mouse button to return
directly to the main menu. Then select <code>create/line/two pos</code>.
You have now activated the function that creates lines between two positions. In
order to snap the line to the points you created, switch snap mode
by pressing the <code>on</code> button in the lower part of the menu window.
</p>

<p>
Now, move the mouse to the graphic window and use the left mouse button
to create the line by first selecting one point and then selecting the other.
Exit the line function and return to menu mode by pressing the right mouse
button. This is what your model looks like right now:

you have 3 minutes left !
