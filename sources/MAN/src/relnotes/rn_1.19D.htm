<h1>Release notes for Varkon 1.19D</h1>

<p>
The release of Varkon 1.19D is not as dramatic as the release of 1.19C
when many things were changed. Most of the changes in 1.19D are bugfixes
but new functionality has also been added, mainly related to the new mbs
function PCA(), (see below). The following is a list of updates made to
the svn source code repository since the release of Varkon 1.19C.
</p>


<h2>svn#100</h2>

<p>
In order to make it possible to run Varkon without write privileges
to the installation directory VARKON_ROOT, the startup logfile (Varkon.LOG)
is moved from VARKON_ROOT to VARKON_TMP and the default job directory is
changed from VARKON_ROOT to the users home directory ($HOME).
</p>

<h2>svn#101</h2>

<p>
Bug (SourceForge Tracker ID = 1864384) "Trim with arcs does not work" fixed.
This bug appeared in 1.19C as a result of the merged 2D and 3D mode. Note
that Trim is still basically a 2D operation and only works as it should in
the XY-plane of the BASIC coordinate system. 
</p>

<h2>svn#102</h2>

<p>
In order to implement a new method to create a coordinate system, CSYS_USRDEF(), its manual pages and skeleton of all  C functions has been added to the system. Be aware that the implementation is not finished yet.

<p>
The final commit of CSYS_USRDEF() procedure.
</p>
