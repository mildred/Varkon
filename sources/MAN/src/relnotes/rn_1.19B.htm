<h1>Release notes for Varkon 1.19B</h1>

<p>
Varkon 1.19B is a big step towards a completely new graphical user
interface (GUI) with new functionality and new &quot;feel and look&quot;.
The new GUI is based on new dialog windows and new types of graphical
windows. Varkon 1.19B is released in order to get feedback on the
changes made so far. We hope to continue the development of the new
GUI and aim on a new major release Varkon 2.0 later on. This means
that Varkon 1.19B will only be available for Unix/Linux. We do not
plan to release 1.19B for Microsoft Windows. It also means that the
documentation is not 100% updated. We do feel however that 1.19B is
much easier to use than previous versions of Varkon and we hope that
you will not hesitate to try it out. Please give us all feedback you
can, it's a great help in the development.</p>

<p>Here are some features of the new GUI:</p>

<ul>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A new color theme with different
colors for button's, backgrounds and highlighted buttons.

<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A new interactive graphical window
(WPRWIN) based on OpenGL</P>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Enhanced graphical window (WPGWIN)
window based on X-Windows with 2D- or 3D-grid that can be used as a
help to enter positions. The 3D-grid is automatically aligned to the
XY-plane of the currently active coordinate system</P>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Surfaces can be visualized shaded
with light or as wireframes</P>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">New graphical attributes NULINES
and NVLINES control the number of curves used for wireframe display

PSIZE control the font and size of points</P>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Buttons replaced with icons
(contributed by Maciek) in graphical windows</P>
</ul>

<p>Varkon 1.19B also includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A new text oriented file format
for JOB-files. JOB-files are now compatible over all platforms. The
new JOB-files are however not compatible with earlier versions of
Varkon. This means that if you load a job created with an earlier
version of Varkon all JOB settings (views, levels etc) you may have
done will be reset to their default values.</P>

<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A new plotter/printer
configuration system. Configuration is interactive and settings are
stored in a text file.</P>

<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Basic support for trimmed
surfaces. Trimcurves are either cubic/rational or NURBS curves in
the UV-plane of the surface. A new MBS routine CUR_COMP_ARR can be
used to create trimcurves. A new MBS routine SUR_TRIM_USRDEF can be
used to create a surface with trimcurves.</P>
</ul>

<p>Here are some things we have removed from the system:</p>

<UL>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Support for &quot;Drawing scale&quot;.
MBS routine ACT_DSCL is removed. 
</P>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Support for old type
Tektronix/VT100 graphical displays. 
</P>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">MBS routine SHADE_VIEW is replaced
by the functionality of the new graphics window. 
</P>
<LI><P>MBS routine MATERIAL_VIEW changes to CRE_MATERIAL in order to
be analogous with CRE_PEN.</P>
</UL>

<p>And finally a few known bugs:</p>

<UL>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The HIDE function (hidden line
removal) is not working. This will be fixed in the next release.</P>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">User defined materials may be
defined but have no effect. This will be fixed in the next release.</P>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">User defined light sources may be
defined but have no effect. This will be fixed in the next release.</P>
</UL>
