<p><b><font size="+1">Release notes for VARKON version 1.18A</font></b></p>
</center>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <p>Varkon function ABS() failed when called with an expression as
input. <br>
Bug corrected in evmath.c and Varkon_1.17D distribution files renewed
2003-04-04. <br>
  <br>
Varkon gemetric procedure CUR_CONIC( ) failed. <br>
Bug corrected in excurve.c and Varkon_1.17D distribution files renewed
2003-04-04.
&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
  <p>Mbsc failed when constants or parameter values where declared in
MBS
with an expression as input. <br>
Bug corrected and Varkon_1.17D distribution files renewed 2003-04-10. </p>
  <p>Bug in PM corrected 2004-03-10 . Garbage collection failed in
Drawing
mode. PM could grow uncontrolled <br>
until system crashed. </p>
  <p>Bug in&nbsp; DB corrected 2004-03-10. Problem related to data loss
in
big models (&gt;10Mb). </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">Bug related to interactive delete
corrected 2004-04-29. Deleted
entity
was not automatically removed from the display.</p>
  <p>Maximum length of jobnames, partnames, groupnames and names for
coordinate systems has been extended to 31 characters. <br>
  </p>
  <p>Indexes for variables (arrays and matrices) are now 32 bit
integers meaning that it is now possible to declare and use variables
in MBS<br>
with indexes exceeding the old limit of 32768 (2**16). Max limit is now
2**32.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Sequence numbers and order numbers for ID:s
(#sequence_number.order_number.)&nbsp; are now 32 bit integers. This
means that it <br>
is now possible to create entities with higher ID's than before. <br>
  </p>
  <p>The WIDTH attribute can now be used also for B-planes.<br>
  </p>
  <p>A new entity type MESH has been added. A mesh consists of vertices
and optionally also edges and faces. MESH_ARR() creates a mesh,
SORT_MESH()&nbsp; sorts the vertices. GETMSHH(), GETVERTEX(),
GETHEDGE(), GETFACE() and GETXFLOAT() can be used to retrieve mesh data from the
database. We use the mesh entity in the CAD-research project to
represent point data measured from the surfaces of real world objects
using a laser scanner. <br>
  </p>
  <p>The sources for the Microsoft Windows version of Varkon have been
prepared for release as free software under the same conditions as the
Linux version of the system (GNU/LGPL) and will be included in version
1.18A of the source code distribution.<br>
  </p>
  <p>A bug related to points with the WIDTH-attribute set in the Dyn-R
window has been fixed.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Arc's are now correctly displayed in the Dyn-R window.<br>
  </p>
  <p>File paths including slashes "/"&nbsp; (UNIX style) and/or
backslashes "\"&nbsp; (Windows style) can now be used in both the UNIX-
and the Windows-version of the system. Varkon automatically replaces
any slashes with backslahes in the Windows version of the system and
contrary with the Unix version. This faciliates multi platform support
of applications.<br>
  <br>
  </p>

  <p>As set of routines to support communication with ABB robots have 
been added (only UNIX version).
The communication is performed via RAP (Robot Application Protocol), 
which in turn is implemented via RPC (Remote Procedure Calls).
To use the RAP-routines, they must be included when building xvarkon, 
se $VARKON_ROOT/sorces/makefile   <br>
  </p>


<p>
ODBC support is now also available in the linux version of varkon. See README_ODBC in the sources directory.<br>
  <br>
  </p>

<p>
Database routines getdat_gm(), putdat_gm() and deldat_gm() now also support data of type REF and VECTOR.<br>
  <br>
  </p>


  <p><br>
  <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE
!!!</span> </span>Version 1.18A of Varkon is not fully compatible with
earlier versions of Varkon. MBO- or RES-files created with version 1.17
or earlier will not work in 1.18A. All other file formats like MBS,
JOB, PLT, DOC, PID, MDF will work without changes in 1.18.<br>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;To create MBO-files compatible with 1.18 you need to
recompile your MBS files with the MBS compiler included in 1.18. If you
have jobs with MBO-files but no corresponding MBS-files you need to
decompile your MBO-files into MBS format with 1.17 and then recompile
the MBS files with 1.18.<br>
