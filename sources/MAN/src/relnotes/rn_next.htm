<h1>Release notes for next version of Varkon</h1>

<p>
The development of Varkon continues with main focus on the new GUI,
trimmed surfaces and the release of the version for Microsoft
Windows. The sources in the svn repository are updated on a regular
basis and changes are documented here:
</p>


<h2>svn#100</h2>

<p>
In order to make it possible to run Varkon without write privileges
to the installation directory VARKON_ROOT, the startup logfile (Varkon.LOG)
is moved from VARKON_ROOT to VARKON_TMP and the default job directory is
changed from VARKON_ROOT to the users home directory ($HOME).
</p>

<h2>svn#101</h2>

<p>
Bug (SourceForge Tracker ID = 1864384) "Trim with arcs does not work" fixed.
This bug appeared in 1.19C as a result of the merged 2D and 3D mode. Note
that Trim is still basically a 2D operation and only works as it should in
the XY-plane of the BASIC coordinate system. 
</p>

<h2>svn#102</h2>

<p>
In order to implement a new entity which is CSYS_USRDEF(), its manual pages and skeleton of all  C functions has been added to the system. Be aware that the implementation is not finished yet.
</p>

<h2>svn#108</h2>

<p>
A bug related to interactive input of positions corrected. System crached if the user switched position method from on/end/int/cent during input in a MACRO call.
</p>

<h2>svn#109</h2>

<p>
A bug related to interactive entity delete in generic mode corrected. If the user selected an entity defined by a labled statement for delete and the entity was referenced the entity was not blanked and a system error (IG3523) was issued.
