
Hi,

This is the default help text for Varkon. The Varkon help-
system displays html pages from the Varkon documentation.
To do that Varkon must know which html reader you prefer.

If this text is displayed you have not yet configured your
varkon system to use a html reader (web browser) or the
configuration you have is not working properly.

This is how you configure your html reader:

1. Move yourself to VARKON_ROOT/cnf/ini/english
   (or VARKON_ROOT/cnf/ini/swedish if you use the
   swedish version of Varkon).
   VARKON_ROOT is the directory where you have
   installed you Varkon system.

2. Open the file named linux in a text editor

3. Find the following lines:

!***Suse Linux with KDE can use Konqueror
!varkon.html_viewer:             konqueror
!
!***Many Linux systems use firefox or seamonkey
!varkon.html_viewer:             firefox
!varkon.html_viewer:             seamonkey
!
!***Mozilla may also work
!varkon.html_viewer:             mozilla
!
!***The following line will spawn the default browser on MacOSX systems
!varkon.html_viewer:             open

4. Uncomment (remove the exclamation mark on) the line including the
   browser you want to use or add a line with the name of another browser.
   (If you get another browser working, please let us know so we can include
   it in the ini file for the next release of Varkon)

5. Close the file and restart Varkon. Press F1, <CTRL>a or any
   Help-button to verify that your browser configuration is working
   correctly. If it does, your browser will start and display
   Varkon documentation. If not, try another browser or post a
   message about your problem on the Varkon mailing list.

6. Next time you install a new version of Varkon you will have to repeat
   this procedure. To avoid this we recommend you create a personal
   ini-file. How to do this is described in the Ini-files section of
   the System administrators manual.
