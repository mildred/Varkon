
Hi,

This is the default help text for Varkon. The Varkon help-
system displays html pages from the Varkon documentation.
To do that Varkon must know which html reader you prefer.

If this text is displayed you have not yet configured your
varkon system to use a html reader (web browser) or the
configuration you have is not working properly.

TODO:

A good instruction on how to configure the ini-file.
