      Varkon documentation sources README
      ===================================

The Varkon documentation sources are located in the
VARKON_ROOT/sources/MAN/src directory. The documentation
included in the distribution packages is automatically
created from the sources with the Makfile included in the
VARKON_ROOT/sources/MAN/src directory.

All documentation (except this README) is in html format.

Documentation source pages usually #include a header and a
footer located in VARKON_ROOT/sources/MAN/include. The footer
depends the file svnversion.inc to include the current SVN version
number on each page.

Each page also depends on a stylesheet, see
VARKON_ROOT/sources/MAN/src/varkonstyle.css

Conventions used in the Varkon documentation are:

1. Use <p> rather than <P> (lower case letters between brackets)
2. All pages eventually displayed on the SourceForge web server
   must include the SourceForge logo. Do this by using the appropriate
   header and/or footer.
3. Use <code>path/filename</code> to highligt paths or file names
   used in examples.
4. Use <h1>Major heading</h1> or <h2>Minor heading</h2> for headlines.
5. Use <img class="center" src="image_file"></img> for images.
6. Use <pre class="box">Some text</pre> for MBS code examples etc.
7. Use <code>alt1/alt2/alt3</code> to refer to menu selections.
8. When refering to Varkon always use Uppercase "V" and lower case "arkon".
9. Use menu/create/line/offset etc. when referring to menu selections
