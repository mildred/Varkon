1.  Select a directory where to install the Varkon system
    and unzip and untar the distribution file into this
    directory. The distribution file tree has a top
    directory named varkon_1.19B. This will become
    the varkon root directory, VARKON_ROOT.

2.  Make sure you have read and write privileges to all
    directories and files belonging to VARKON_ROOT.

3.  cd to $VARKON_ROOT/sources

4.  You might need to edit the makefile named "makefile"
    to reflect the name of your UNIX platform. "linux" is
    default so if you have a GNU/linux system  with gcc you
    don't need to change anything.  If you are running another
    UNIX system you have to change the PLATFORM variable in the
    makefile  accordingly.

5.  The makefiles, by default, assume you have X11 and OpenGL
    installed. It is not possible to build Varkon 1.19B and
    later versions without X11 and OpenGL. If the compiler
    complains about missing X11/OpenGL includefiles or libs
    you must install them. If they are installed and it still
    doesn't work you might have to edit your makefile to point
    to their exact location.

6.  If you want to build Varkon with support for ODBC,
    follow the instructions in the file README_ODBC in the
    sources directory. See the MBS manual pages for i"ODBC
    database routines" for instructions how to communicate
    with an external database.
 
7.  Run make by just typing 'make' in a terminal window
    while you are positioned in the sources directory.
    Make will then build and install the new binaries. You
    might need a cup of coffe meanwhile....

8.  If this doesn't work, please contact us with a description
    of your problem. If you can supply us with a printout
    from make it helps a lot.

9.  Finally, follow the instructions in VARKON_ROOT/README
    to configure the system for your environment.

    Good luck,
