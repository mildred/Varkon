/*
***This file includes default versions of error
***handling routines used by the Varkon system.
***You can use these or write your own if you want to
***(see below).
***This file is provided as a default replacement of the
***original VARKON routines which are more complex
***and rely on a lot of VARKON specific code.
*/

/*
***First of all include the standard C header file.

#include <stdio.h>

/*
***The error handling system used by Varkon is
***based on 4 different routines. erpush() is used
***to push an errror message on the error message stack.
***erlerr() returns the last error code.
***erinit() is used to clear the stack and errmes() is
***used to display the stack to the user.
***
***Error messages are 6-character strings composed
***of 2 initial letters and 4 trailing digits.
***Here is an example: "GE2642"
***The two characters "GE" indicate what module
***the error comes from, The Varkon GE-module in
***this case. The last digit is treated as a severity
***code as follows:
***Severity = 0 means OK, ie. no error.
***Severity = 1 is a warning only.
***Severity = 2 is a non recoverable user error.
***Severity = 3 is a non recoverable system error.
***Severity = 4 is a panic error.
***The remaining 3 digits is just a number, unique
***within the module, that relate to the specific
***error. In Varkon these error numbers are used
***to locate a textual description of the error
***from an external file. Different files for
***different languages.
***
***We decided to supply the three following simplified
***replacements for the original Varkon versions.
***You may use them if you wish or replace them
***with something better of your own choice.
