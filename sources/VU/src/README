1. cd to the VU/src directory

2. Remove any sourcefiles you want to
   replace with code of your own. Optionally
   edit the Makefile.

3. If you plan to replace the entire VU
   module with code of your own you don't
   have to compile anything but Makefiles
   in the DB and GE module may have to be
   edited to remove the VU library dependacy.

4. If you want to use the VU library as it is,
   a Makefile for linux is included in the VU/src
   directory. Type "make -f Makefile.linux" to
   build the VU library.
