1. Make sure you have built the DB library and
   VU library, DBlib.a and VUlib.a
   See DB/src/README and VU/src/README

2. You must also make the EX library.
   See EX/src/README

3. cd to the EX/demo directory

4. Run make. This  compiles and
   links the EXdemo programs

5. Run the programs. Too see what they do, read
   the sources of each program.
   They are fairly well commented.
