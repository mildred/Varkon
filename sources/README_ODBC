ODBC-support was implemented in the Windows version of Varkon several years
ago but has not been included in the Unix version of Varkon until now.
The first person to do this was Richard Shepard who tried it all out using
a Sun machine with Solaris. Using Richard's instructions we then did the same 
thing on a Linux system (Suse 9.1). This file includes Richards instructions
for Sun/Solaris and after that our own experiences from building the system
using Suse Linux.

                  ODBC and SUN/Solaris by Richard Shepard

This document is a step-by-step guide explaining how to build Varkon with 
ODBC support. 
It is geared towards MyODBC and MySQL on Sun in particular but should be 
applicable, to some extent, to other packages and platforms as well.

- install MyODBC-3.51.06 (or later) libs in /usr/local/lib.
  It is available at http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/3.51.html

- install unixODBC-2.1.1 (or later) which you can get from 
  http://www.unixodbc.org    (or add sql.h, sqltypes.h and sqlext.h from 
  unixODBC to /usr/local/include)
  (you may be able to use sql.h, sqltypes.h and sqlext.h from the Solaris 
  Adabas install instead)

- install libodbcinst.so.1.0.0 from unixODBC in /usr/local/lib

- create links libodbcinst.so and libodbcinst.so.1 in usr/local/lib
	cd /usr/local/lib
	su
	ln -ns libodbcinst.so.1.0.0 libodbcinst.so
	ln -ns libodbcinst.so.1.0.0 libodbcinst.so.1

- create link to libmyodbc3 in usr/local/lib
	ln -ns libmyodbc3.3-3.51.06.so libmyodbc3.so

  NOTE: version numbers will be different if you downloaded a later version

- add "SQLLIBS = -lmyodbc3 -lodbcinst" to sources/Makefile.sun:

	# ODBC/SQL libs
	SQLLIBS = -lmyodbc3 -lodbcinst

- add "$(SQLLIBS)" to gcc line in sources/Makefile.sun:

	$(XVARKON): $(LIBS)
		gcc -O3 $(LIBS) $(XLIBS) $(GLIBS) -lm $(CLIBS) $(SQLLIBS) -o $(XVARKON)

- the "CFLAGS" line in EX/src/Makefile.sun should have "-DV3_ODBC" added, e.g.:

	CFLAGS = -O3 -I/usr/openwin/include -ffloat-store -fsigned-char -fwritable-strings -DUNIX -DV3_OPENGL -DV3_ODBC -DV3_X11 -DWRK_STAT


- Rebuild

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    ODBC and Suse-Linux

Includefiles and libraries for ODBC are included in the Suse distribution
of Linux. Includefiles sql.h and sqltypes.h and sqlext.h are installed
in /usr/include. The library libodbcinst.so is installed in /usr/lib 
but the library libmyodbc3.so is installed in /usr/lib/unixODBC.

To get things working, edit Makefile in sources directory and
uncomment the line DV3ODBC=TRUE. This will force the compiler to include
the ODBC calls in the Varkon code. 

If libmyodbc3.so is installed in another place than 
/usr/lib/unixODBC, you will need to edit the Makefile.linux in 
the sources directory. SQLLIBS = ... 

Now it's time to rebuild the system.

Finally, edit your startscript (the file named varkon in the com/swedish
or com/english directory) and uncomment the 2 lines defining the 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable. 

You should now be able to start Varkon and run the system as usual. To
make actual ODBC calls you must also install the MySQL database of
course. We have not done this yet, we have only built the system so far.
If anyone tries to actually use Varkon with MySQL (or another database)
we would be glad to know the result. Contact:
